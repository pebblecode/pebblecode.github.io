The purpose of brand is to strongly identify things that are consistent with the company ethic. A lot of this is visual, but text, audio, and physical artefacts can all contribute to the brand. 

By taking every opportunity to reinforce the brand, we strengthen ourselves as a team. This contributes directly to the success of the company, and by association you as an individual. 




##Visual Guidelines

The brand assets are kept [here](https://drive.google.com/a/pebblecode.com/folderview?id=0B4mkyflO8zoEb0lwZzQxUW1hT0E&usp=sharing). Do not keep a local copy of branded elements such as templates or logos as these are liable to be updated.

**If in doubt about the use of these assets, ask a member of the design team.**

###Logo

There are two logos, the square logo and the rectangle logo. The pebble {code} logo is set in FF Meta Bold.

####Rectangle Logo

![Example of a heading](/img/brand/pebble-logo.png)

This is the default logo. It is used on the company website, and any paper document such as wireframes, statements of work or credentials. There are four versions:

* **Pink on white** (for print documents).
* **White on Pink** (for digital documents not intended for print, and the company website).
* **Pink on Transparent** (for use on top of any other brand colour where appropriate).
* **White on Transparent** (for emergency use where another background is required. There needs to be a *very* good reason to use this over the other options).

There should be a single space between pebble and {code}. Where possible the curly braces ({}) should be included. In the past there have been incorrect versions of the logo that have crept in. If you see any of the following incorrect uses, you should let the owner of the document know that they need to correct this.

* pebble {code} ✔

* Pebble {Code} ✘

* pebble{code} ✘

* pebble code ✘


####Square Logo

![Example of a heading](/img/brand/pebble-square-logo.png)

This logo is primarily for avatar situations, where a square branded element is required. For example in listings sites, or for Github. It should not be used in place of the rectangle logo (e.g. on a print document).

* **Meta** (for body text)

The fonts can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B4mkyflO8zoEUFZSV2VKQ29WNjg).

####Headings

<h1 style="background-color:#EE4F7E;color:white;padding:2vw">Jet from Gladiators to host a millennium barn dance at Yeovil aerodrome.</h1>

Notice that headings are always capitalised. Drop Shadows can be used optionally. The drop shadow values are:

`text-shadow: 3px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2);`

####Body Copy
This document is set in the correct body copy style, i.e. Meta, pebble ink. Blockquotes may be highlighted in pebble pink: 

> Big Yellow Taxi there by Joni Mitchell, a song in which she complains that they 'paved paradise to put up a parking lot' - a measure which actually would have alleviated traffic congestion on the outskirts of paradise. Something which Joni singularly fails to point out, perhaps because it doesn't quite fit in with her blinkered view of the world. Nevertheless, nice song. 




###Lab banner graphics

![Example of a heading](/img/brand/pebble-lab-banner-logo-pink-white-1500x500.png)
This branding element is used in places where visual interest is needed to make the branded artefact stand out. Sometimes the pebble pink can become too slab-like and overwhelming. The white-on-pink banner breaks up that effect somewhat. The pink-on-white banner is useful for title pages of documents.
