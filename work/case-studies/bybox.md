problem-title: The Problem
problem-illustration: v2/people-2.svg
problem-summary-lrg: Multi-site workers, such as field engineers, spend more time in between jobs trudging back and forth to the warehouse than fixing problems. Life becomes a delivery waiting game.
problem-summary: In 2000, ByBox launched an electronic locker bank that allowed users to enter a passcode on a tablet interface on the locker to reach their packages, without having to sign with a delivery man or remember a key. These lockers enabled cheaper overnight deliveries, but were expensive to produce and operate, requiring power and network connectivity.<br><br>More recently, ByBox have turned to emerging wireless technologies and mobile devices in order to streamline the delivery process further and produce cost-effective locker solutions that can be installed anywhere.

method-title: The Methods

# Method 1
method1-title: Research and development
method1-summary: We began testing the capabilities of Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE). In collaboration with ByBoxâ€™s hardware supplier, we designed a secure firmware and protocol for BLE lock modules that enables users to control the locks via their smartphone.

# Method 2
method2-title: Rapid Prototyping
method2-summary: Our rapid prototyping process allowed us to quickly test the concept and deliver a working application in a matter of weeks.

# Method 3
method3-title: UI Design
method3-summary: UX/UI specialists embarked on User Research to better understand the problem from a customer standpoint, generating wireframes to map user workflows, and finally applying aesthetically pleasing and easy-to-use design.
