popup1-title: User Experience Strategy and Research
popup1-summary: By taking design decisions through rigorous User Research we are able to test assumptions, uncover latent requirements and design digital products from a robust evidence base. By involving users at every step of the design we ensure that digital products are relevant and offer value to end users.
