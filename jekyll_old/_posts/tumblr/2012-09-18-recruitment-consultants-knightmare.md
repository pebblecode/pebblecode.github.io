<p>pebble {code} is a pretty good candidate for using Recruitment Consultants. We are working on some long term projects that are growing fast and it is likely we&rsquo;ll be adding further clients to our portfolio. For the vast majority of cases we use our network, community sites like <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> or find people through our own staff or peers. We have managed to find some great people this way. More recently we have been using a few recruitment companies with very mixed results.</p>

<p>In discussions with recruitment consultants to date there is an initial spray gun of words like &lsquo;OO JavaScript&rsquo;, 'Big Data&rsquo;, 'Full Stack&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m often told that someone is going to 'make my day&rsquo; or that 'I&rsquo;m in luck&rsquo;. We have given Recruitment Companies a short, targeted brief of the type of person we are looking for. I&rsquo;d estimate that two thirds of the CVs I have read that have come from Recruitment Consultants are not at all close to the skill set we are looking for. There is little curation of candidates, and a sketchy understanding of skill sets. I feel guilty but I am beginning to assume that recruitment consultants don&rsquo;t understand the industry well enough and are so busy chasing commissions that they are not curating candidates as they should.</p>

<p>To be clear a service that I&rsquo;m willing to pay good money for is</p>

<ul><li>A consultant that understands the market and skill sets </li>
<li>A consultant that is proactive but knows when not to call</li>
<li>A consultant that can curate candidates for my requirements</li>
<li>A consultant that understands that reviewing code is as important as interviewing</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2012-September/008072.html">recent thread</a> on the <a href="http://lrug.org/">LRUG</a> mailing list shows that many people in the industry feel the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t want volume. I don&rsquo;t even want particularly high speed. I certainly don&rsquo;t want cold-calls or cold emails, <em>ever</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps I am naive in the thought that recruitment consultants should make the process of recruiting some take less time than it would without them.</p>
