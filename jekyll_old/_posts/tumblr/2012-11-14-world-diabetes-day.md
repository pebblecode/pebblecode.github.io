<p>Today is world diabetes day. As we’ve just started working with the International Insulin Foundation we thought today would be a great day to talk a little about the project and a little about what we’ve already learned about diabetes.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdh715Oz4N1r1hmko.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>We are going to be working with the International Insulin Foundation to produce a website for their new campaign. The 100 Campaign aims to give access to insulin to 100% of the world by the year 2022. 2022 marks 100 years since the first use of insulin.</p>

<p>You can follow the campaign on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/100campaign">here</a> and on Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/100Campaign">here</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst we’ve only just started working on the project we’ve already learned a lot about diabetes and insulin access. Most of our existing ideas about diabetes and insulin were challenged and we’re now just starting to understand the extreme importance of the work of the International Insulin Foundation.</p>

<p>One of the most shocking issues we’ve been talking about within the diabetes community is the difference of accessing insulin between resource rich and resource poor countries. For example the cost of insulin treatment in Mozambique can be up to 75% of the average yearly wage.</p>
