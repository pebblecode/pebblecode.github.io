<p>On Wednesday 24th July we welcomed in the Summer with another internal hack-day. As always we were impressed by the enthusiasm everyone brought to the day but this hack day saw an even greater number of high quality ideas.</p>

<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="378" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DkO-5xUV2V4" width="672"></iframe></p>

<p>The theme of the day was <strong>art</strong>, specifically ‘generative’ art. Many people were stuck for ideas at first but quickly got into the flow of things once the day started.</p>

<p>Here’s a rundown of the creations:</p>

<h3>1. ADAM, Automatic Demon Acquisition Machine</h3>

<p><strong>Mark:</strong></p>

<p>Marks projects generates random <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=transmutation+circle&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=yUb_UYaCEYerOoPtgfAG&amp;biw=1152&amp;bih=670&amp;sei=1Ub_UerVNIeW0AX--IDwCg" title="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=transmutation+circle&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=yUb_UYaCEYerOoPtgfAG&amp;biw=1152&amp;bih=670&amp;sei=1Ub_UerVNIeW0AX--IDwCg">transmutation circles</a> using <a href="http://paperjs.org/" title="http://paperjs.org/">paper.js</a>. Firstly random glyphs are created by connecting a series of grid points and then these glyphs are put into a random geometric shape. Mark also wrapped the project in an <em>interesting</em> narrative about summoning demons.</p>

<h3>2. Render the Matrix &trade;</h3>

<p><strong>Nathan, Martin:</strong></p>

<p>Nathan and Martin faithfully recreated the ‘matrix code’ from the film trilogy of the same name. This was done using rapheal.js and a special font they found. It was great to see a project that everyone geek side could really appreciate.</p>

<h3>3. RACI: Random and Awesome Collage Images</h3>

<p><strong>Simon, James, Emma:</strong></p>

<p>RACI was our largest team and this showed in the complexity and variety of function that their project achieved. RACI takes one (or several) source images and uses sections of these images to create a replication of a target image. The team included several different modes to use and some great examples!</p>

<h3>4. Darkness</h3>

<p><strong>Tak:</strong></p>

<p>Tak’s art/game darkness definitely takes the prize for most hardware in a project using both the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/" title="https://www.leapmotion.com/">leap motion</a> and an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" title="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>. Darkness is a collaborative game where multiple players can paint on a collaborative canvas using either the mouse or a <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/" title="https://www.leapmotion.com/">leap motion</a>. Tak also used some potentiometers hooked up to the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" title="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> to control the background colour of the canvas.</p>

<h3>5. Leapy.Arty.Farty</h3>

<p><strong>Andy:</strong></p>

<p>Andy’s Leapy Arty Farty project used the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/" title="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap motion</a> controller to draw very detailed and varied shapes on a blank canvas. The leap integration was stellar, even including the swipe gesture to clear the screen - the added music was a very nice touch.</p>

<h3>6. PaperSpiro</h3>

<p><strong>Matt:</strong></p>

<p>Matt spent his day experimenting with <a href="http://paperjs.org/" title="http://paperjs.org/">paper.js</a> and came up with a huge variety of small experiments. What we really loved about this hack was the variety of the different experiments and the clear progression it showed as Matt learned how to utilise the power of <a href="http://paperjs.org/" title="http://paperjs.org/">paper.js</a>.</p>

<h3>7. HippoPass</h3>

<p><strong>John:</strong></p>

<p>HippoPass (named after the hippocampus section of the brain) was John’s hack aimed at solving the problem of remembering passwords. Working on the knowledge that humans are very very good at remembering images, even those we have seen for only a short time, John created a system where a series of image grids could be used instead of passwords. John used PHP, JS and the Flickr API.</p>

<h3>8. Square Beats</h3>

<p><strong>Rytis:</strong></p>

<p>Our first 3d hack! Rytis used the Unity game engine and his machines microphone the visualise music playing in the room. Using beat detection Rytis made a 3D scene ‘dance’ to our stereo!</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/ed0eb25121f22d717a9e5a4c4024004d/tumblr_inline_mr454oOBXh1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>



<h3>9. Julia Songs</h3>

<p><strong>Tom:</strong></p>

<p>Tom’s hack was also about visualising music but took a very different approach. Julia songs used ‘julia set’ fractal imagery which responded to music played through integration with the SoundCloud API. Definately our most psychedelic hack!</p>

<p><a href="http://tomsquires.github.io/" title="http://tomsquires.github.io/">Live Demo</a> (you must be signed into soundcloud for the app to work) <a href="https://github.com/tomsquires/julia-songs" title="https://github.com/tomsquires/julia-songs">Gihub repository</a></p>

<h3>10. Colour</h3>

<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Peter created a web app that lets you mix colours like you would when painting and grab the resulting hex codes. We can all see this app going far as it could be of real use to designers everywhere.</p>

<h3>11. Andrew</h3>

<p>Andrew very kindly brought in one of his <a href="http://nodecopter.com/" title="Nodecopters">Nodecopters</a> to play with. We then tried to draw on our whiteboard walls with the nodecopter. Unfortunately the added weight of the markers made the Nodecopter very unstable which resulted in a few crashes. Still it was a great attempt.</p>

<p>After the day was over we all voted on our favourite project and it was very close with only one vote between the top two hacks. The winner and runner up each received a prize before we headed off to a great night out curtsey of the pebble summer party. And the winner is…</p>

<p><strong>Darkness, by Tak!</strong> We were all very impressed with the collaborative nature of his hack as well as all the hardware inputs. <strong>Leapy.Arty.Farty, by Andy</strong> took second place - again we were all impressed with the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/" title="https://www.leapmotion.com/">leap motion</a> integration but it was really Andy’s killer demo that sealed the deal.</p>

<p>Everyone here really enjoyed the day and is already looking forward to the next one. It was so great to see true innovation in action and further understand why this creativity with code is such an important part of success with our client projects.</p>

<p>If you are interested in getting involved with the next pebble hack day please let us know as the next one is going to be bigger and better than ever!</p>
