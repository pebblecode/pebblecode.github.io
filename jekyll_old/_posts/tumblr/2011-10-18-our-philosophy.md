<p>Work should be fun! I am not saying that when working at pebble it&rsquo;s all roses, but we really do do what we can to make it fun, enjoyable and rewarding to work here.

How do we do this?

People are your business&rsquo; greatest asset - a happy and motivated employee is going to work harder and better. There are a few factors that we consider:

</p><ul><li>Work-life balance - over-working sucks. We encourage only working in office hours and make sure that everyone goes home on time. Time away from work is crucial. Also, if people need to work from home, or would just rather do that, then that is fine - do what you need! We even have one developer working in New Zealand!</li>

<li>Type of work - having boring projects just to make a bit of extra money is not the way we like to do things. We try hard to only accept target work - for us, this is hard problem solving that involves multiple members of the team. Web apps, tick. Content sites, cross! Solving challenging problems is satisfying and working with others is more fun and more productive than working by yourself. </li>

<li>Office space - it is essential to give people an inspirational place to work - we are all spending the majority of our waking lives in this space, so why not make it nice?! Would you buy a cheap bed?
</li></ul>
