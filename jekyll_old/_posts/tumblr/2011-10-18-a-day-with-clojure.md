<p><img align="left" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpaou2Qbwj1qdcl2v.gif" alt="Clojure" width="120" height="100"/>It started with trying to find something to do for 10% time - there were <a title="Sinatra" href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">some</a> <a title="MacRuby" href="http://www.macruby.org/">technologies</a> I wanted to <a title="Processing js" href="http://processingjs.org/">play</a> with - but in a twist of fate <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/7/5/clojure_on_heroku/">Heroku announced it&rsquo;s support</a> of <a title="Clojure" href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> on their cloud service. That really got my attention.</p>
<p>Clojure is a functional programming language, with Lisp like syntax, built on the Java JVM. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to get back into some form of functional programming, ever since experiencing the elegance of Haskell in 1st year uni. I&rsquo;ve also been hearing <a title="Stackoverflow podcast" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/category/podcasts/">advice</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Soho-School-Nights/events/24486531/">here</a> and <a title="Ruby Rogues" href="http://rubyrogues.com/">there</a> to learn different paradigms of programming, as a way of improving your programming ability - which I really agree with. I was already learning ruby and objective c, so I had dynamically typed and statically typed languages covered. Functional was the main other paradigm I was missing.</p>
<p>The problem I find with functional languages like Haskell though, is that they seem to be stuck within the domain of academia, or very obscure problem domains. I prefer pragmatic languages that have more usage in industry. Heroku&rsquo;s support was a great plus on that side of things.</p>
<p>My day with Clojure mainly revolved around getting started with Clojure, getting it deployed, checking out the community of Clojure, and seeing what it can be used for.</p>
<p>In terms of getting started and deployed, Heroku made it very easy with their <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure">Getting started guide</a>. I think I was all done within 20mins. The dependency framework, <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">leiningen</a>, much like bundler for ruby, saved me a lot of time in setting up the environment.</p>
<p>I was quite surprised by the number of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3325033/comparison-of-clojure-web-frameworks">web frameworks</a> already available and ready to be used. However, after some cursory coding, it did feel a little clunky to work in a functional paradigm for the web. Ruby seems like a more agile and intuitive fit, although this may be my familiarity bias. </p>
<p>Apart from the web side of things, I also encountered <a href="https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans">clojure koans</a> which were inspired by <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">ruby koans</a> (also great if you don&rsquo;t already know of them), that really helped to get a grasp of the concepts of clojure. The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/clojure/id275488598">screencasts by Rich Hickey (the creator of clojure) on itunes</a> are also apparently pretty good at teaching the concepts (although, I haven&rsquo;t had time to go through many of them). <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/fulldisclojure">Full disclojure</a> is also another screencast resource I kept hearing about.</p>
<p>Some other tidbits I found along the way were a <a href="http://cemerick.com/2010/06/07/results-from-the-state-of-clojure-summer-2010-survey/">survey on industry usage</a>, <a href="http://try-clojure.org/">an in-browser tool to try out clojure</a>, and <a href="http://planet.clojure.in/">a news site on the latest in clojure</a>.</p>
<p>Although, I didn&rsquo;t end up doing much juicy development in clojure by the end of the day, I did get a good taste of what clojure was about. The community seemed quite friendly, and there&rsquo;s an exciting vibe coming from them. I&rsquo;m keen to look into it further - maybe not necessarily for web development, but I&rsquo;m sure there are some other good use cases around. I definitely agree with heroku&rsquo;s approach of <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/3/polyglot_platform/">supporting the right tool for the job</a>, and Clojure seems like a great tool to add in my developer toolbox.</p>


<p>Update: I went to the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/iincanter-clojure/js-1980">LCUG incanter event</a>, and was very humbled by the very smart and interesting people there - I&rsquo;ll definitely try and attend more of these. There are frequent <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/14594954/">clojure dojos happening in london</a>, for those interested too.</p>
