<p>A quick update on the Sam&rsquo;s Teach Yourself Node.js Book that I&rsquo;ve been authoring. The book is going through final edits now. I hadn&rsquo;t realised how many different rounds of editing there would be! Our designer Mark has designed a <a href="http://nodejsbook.io/">brochure site</a> for the book and you can get a sneak peak of what&rsquo;s included by downloading the <a href="https://github.com/shapeshed/nodejsbook.io.examples/zipball/master">code examples</a> from GitHub. The publishers Pearson Education have put a release date of 1st September on the book and you can pre-order from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-Node-js-Hours-Yourself/dp/0672335956">Amazon US</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Teach-Yourself-Node-js-Hours-Yourself/dp/0672335956">Amazon UK</a>.</p>

<p>We are using Node.js at pebble {code} as part of the online gaming startup we are working on and loving it!</p>
