<p>Collaboration has been a buzz word for some time now, but I still think that it is as important as ever. Making sure that everyone, both internally and externally, are communicating efficiently can make such a huge difference to the project or plan. If you have ever had any trouble with a client on a project, I bet that 9 times out of 10, it would have been down to poor communication - even if it is bad news, people just want to know what is going on. </p>

<p>Here are some of the collaboration tools that we use and love to make our lives better: </p>

<p><a href="http://basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>, (<a href="http://37signals.com">37Signals</a>)</p>

<p>Online, no nonsense, project management tool allowing us to track tasks and milestones easily as well as discuss project topics. We use basecamp to manage client projects, internal projects and our strategy. The design is simple and it is very easy to use. </p>

<p><a href="http://pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a>, (<a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a>)</p>

<p>Online, sprint-orientated, feature/chore/bug tracker for software development. We use Pivotal Tracker for all our software projects that we run and it is perfect for helping us get through the feature requests efficiently and in the right order. Each feature can be assigned an estimate for effort so that when all together we can see an estimated delivery schedule - very helpful. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/docs.html">Google Docs</a>, (<a href="http://google.com">Google</a>)</p>

<p>Online document creation, organisation and collaboration. There are still some things that we struggle with on the way Google does things, but in general, Google Docs is an invaluable resource for us to share documents and spreadsheets, and all view and work on them at the same time. </p>

<p><a href="http://ideapi.com">Ideapi</a>, (<a href="http://pebblecode.com">pebble {code}</a>)</p>

<p>Ideapi is a pebble {code} solution that we have been working on for nearly 2 years - it is designed specifically for the Communications industry to help businesses save time in the idea/response part of the workflow. Ideapi is an online system that facilitates collaboration on briefs and subsequent ideas - if you need to discuss a brief with your clients and then subsequently follow up with ideas, ideapi is for you. </p>

<p>We also use <a href="http://freeagentcentral.com">FreeAgentCentral</a> to track time and manage accounts - we would definitely be lost with it! </p>

<p>If you have an idea for a collaboration system then come and see us - we could help you make it a reality.</p>
