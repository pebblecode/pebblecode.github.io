<p>What a great day. The whole team working on different projects but of the same theme - the team work was fantastic (helped obviously by the numerous table football breaks and bountiful food!). </p>

<p>The projects that emerged from the day were:</p>

<ul><li><b>Fear the IOC</b> - a bookmarklet to censor webpages of any term or image of which the IOC may take offence.</li>
<li><b>Data Visualisations</b> - taking some scraped data of past Olympic medals and visualising it with <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3.js</a>, a very cool Javascript library.</li>
<li><b>Location-sensitive Chat Rooms</b> - a service to allow users to gauge the buzz around a particular location, in this case Olympic venues.</li>
<li><b>Json API for Olympic Data</b> - Json API giving both historical medal data and 2012 schedule data in an easy to consume way.</li>
<li><b>Web Visions</b> - a node.js app taking streaming data from Twitter, 4Square and others and displaying location specific buzz. </li>
</ul><p>And the winner was&hellip; the Json API, written by Alex with help from scrapers Paul and Toby. Awesome. Congratulations Alex. </p>

<p>For blow-by-blow of the day&rsquo;s action, read on.</p>

<p>19:24 - Only 36 mins left of the hackday now until presentations, pizza and beer (well, we may have already had a couple of beers!). The demonstrations have started and the last few teams are frantically getting their day&rsquo;s toil presentable. Screenshots and explanations of submissions coming soon. </p>

<p>15:57 - Just over 4 hours to go! Code getting written, committed and shared. </p>
