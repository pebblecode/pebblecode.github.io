<p>pebble {code}&rsquo;s experienced and friendly team of software developers and designers, is offering <b>one month of free service</b> to a charitable / not-for-profit organisation. Whether you have a problem you need to solve, or want to explore a fresh idea, if we agree that it can be done in one month, we&rsquo;ll have a go!</p>

<p>First and foremost, we want to build a reputation for producing first class software. We&rsquo;re also committed to doing so in a socially responsible manner, and by contributing to the open source community.</p>

<h3>what is open source?</h3>
<p>Open source software is software that anyone can use or modify. We have used software from many open source projects in the past, and want to give back to that community.</p>

<h3>what can we do?</h3>
<p>pebble {code}&rsquo;s main expertise lies in our ability to solve complex problems, although there is a limit to the amount of complexity that we can build in one month with one developer and one designer. Our main available resources at the moment are in our web department. Some realistic project examples that could feasibly be tackled and solved in one month could be:</p>

<ul><li>A web-based database to track donors</li>
<li>An online survey component to your website</li>
<li>A funky data visualisation based on your sector</li>
<li>A web application prototype that tracks projects and contacts</li>
<li>A browser based game</li>
</ul><h3>applications</h3>
<p>Please fill out the simple web form, at the bottom of <a href="http://pebblecode.com/pebbles-good-code">this</a> page, by <b>midday 12th October 2012</b>. Successful applicants will be notified by email shortly after the closing date and we will set up interviews via Skype (or face to face if in London).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re aiming to start and complete a one month project before the end of this year.</p>

<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
