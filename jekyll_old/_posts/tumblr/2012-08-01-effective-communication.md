<p>Collaboration has been a buzz word for some time now and although I
still maintain that there for some things there is no substitute for
face-to-face communication, the right collaboration tools are as
important as ever.</p>

<p>If you have ever had any trouble with a client on a project, I bet
that 9 times out of 10, it was down to poor communication - even if
it&rsquo;s bad news, people just want to know what is going on.</p>

<p>This post explores our favourite tools, software and otherwise, that
help keep pebble {code} communicating efficiently.</p>

<h3><a href="http://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, (<a href="http://37signals.com/">37Signals</a>)</h3>

<p>Online, no nonsense, project management tool allowing us to track
tasks and milestones easily as well as discuss project topics. We use
basecamp to manage client projects, internal projects and our
strategy. The design is simple and it is very easy to use.</p>

<p>We actually use both the New Basecamp and Basecamp Classic, and love them both!</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a>, (Pivotal Labs)</h3>

<p>Online, sprint-orientated, feature/chore/bug tracker for software
development. We use Pivotal Tracker for all our software projects - it
is perfect for helping us get through feature requests efficiently and
in the right order. Each feature can be assigned effort estimates
leading to a more accurate sprint based delivery schedule. Perfect for
agile projects, which is how we work.</p>

<h3><a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a>, (<a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>)</h3>

<p>Another 37signals product, but this time offering online group chat.
Campfire is perfect for remote teams to discuss coding issues and
update progress. You can easily tune out if you are in the middle of
something and then come back to it later and catchup.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.google.com/google-d-s/documents/index.html">Google Docs</a>, (Google)</h3>

<p>Online document creation and collaboration. Perfect for simultaneous
document authoring as well as simple sharing without the need to email
attachments around, internally or externally.</p>

<p>The organisation of files is &lsquo;different&rsquo; to the traditional file
sharing but if you are happy to search for what&rsquo;s needed, Google Docs
won&rsquo;t let you down.</p>

<h3>Daily Catchups</h3>

<p>This is the one process that I wanted to mention that is physical
because it is pretty much the most effective tool at making sure that
everyone is on the same page and fired up for the day. They very
rarely take more than 10 minutes per team and a very worth while
exercise. </p>

<p>Also, once every 2 weeks, on a Friday, we also have lightning catchups, which
are designed to keep everyone in the loop with all the projects going
on in the business. Everyone gets a chance to update everyone else on
what they have been working on and what they are learning. Seems like
a small thing, but has been a really great tool for keeping lines of
communication open and ideas flowing.</p>

<h3>Cloud Working</h3>

<p>Having the majority of our systems and processes in the cloud means
that we can work remotely very effectively and feel secure knowing
that the information that we rely on everyday is safe and secure.</p>

<p>(For reference, other systems that we use and love are: <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> (for code repositories),
<a href="http://www.freeagent.com/">Freeagent Central</a> (for accounting) and <a href="http://highrisehq.com/">Highrise</a> (our CRM).</p>
