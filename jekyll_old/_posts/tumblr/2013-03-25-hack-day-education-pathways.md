<p>Another project we did on the education-themed hack day was one that we coined &ldquo;Education Pathways&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The premise of this was to devise some user experience that allowed a syllabus of course material to be navigated in a logical order, by taking into account the various prerequisites for each particular subject.</p>
<p>The potential scope of this project was very large. We envisioned it as being some sort of central user interface on a next-generation education service. But in the confines of a 12 hour hack day we limited its scope to merely just getting the basics working.</p>
<p>We considered &ldquo;the basics&rdquo; to be a laid-out graph rendering of a syllabus, together with a simple &ldquo;achievement&rdquo; system to demonstrate one of the many ideas we had to introduce gamification to the concept.</p>
<p>We hacked this up using these tools: .NET MVC4, Windows Azure Service Bus and <a href="http://getspringy.com/">Springy.js</a> and of course Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

<p>The achievements system was implemented by allowing the user to click one of the subjects and perform a simple test. They&rsquo;d then submit their answer and if they got it correct they&rsquo;d be awarded with an achievement. The idea was also extended to support &ldquo;achievement paths&rdquo;; so that if for example a user scores 3 answers correctly in a row they&rsquo;d be given an additional achievement. Obviously this was all rather primitive stuff but the ideas have a much grander scope.</p>
<p>The reaction to Education Pathways in the office was very positive. Our colleagues loved the graph representation of a syllabus and considered this, or some form of this, to almost certainly be the user interface of the future in education.</p>
