<p>We publicly released <a href="http://vistazoapp.com/">Vistazo</a> recently - a web app to view and manage a team’s schedule - and now it’s time to take a step back and do some reflection upon the story of our new little Pebble Code baby.</p>

<p>It was a natural and organic growth, and it started with the conception of the idea&hellip;</p>

<h2>Conception</h2>

<p>Vistazo started off as a scratch-our-own-itch type product, when we were struggling to find a simple application that would let us easily keep track of what everyone was working on through the week. We alternated between several different solutions (basecamp, github, pivotal, trello and even a google spreadsheet), and while they were all great products, they weren’t what we wanted here at Pebble Code. Some felt overkill, some felt overly complicated, and some were just clunky to get things done.</p>

<p>That’s when we were incepted with this idea - Hey! We build stuff! We can build this thing ourselves! It’s a simple enough problem to do with a small team, and we can build it to exactly how we want. It’d also be a very nice learning experience for Pebble Code.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw2_QbJcNU">Business time</a></h2>

<p>Vistazo is very much a design driven product, focused primarily on simplicity. We also like the philosophy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">do one thing and do it well</a>, which Vistazo strives for in the space of team scheduling.</p>

<p>Development started with wireframes and design of the interactions, to get an idea of how it would work before we coded it all up.</p>

<p>Having the initial designs and some html mockups, along with choosing some <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">lean</a> <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">technologies</a>, Mark, our resident designer, and I were able to create a usable prototype within a week. This v0.1.0 release had most of what we needed internally, with the ability to view weekly schedules, create projects, and add/remove/drag and drop timetable items. Woot! It was a fun bit of work, and not much of an investment at all.</p>

<h2>Gestation</h2>

<p>Although Vistazo was usable after this 1 week prototype, we felt there was still a lot of opportunity for it to grow, and more we could do with it. So we decided to carry on with our designer-developer duo setup (with great support from the rest of the team along the way) and iterate on 1-2 week sprints to refine the app, and also generalise it to be useful for people outside of Pebble Code.</p>

<p><a href="http://pebbleit.com/">Pebble IT</a>, our sister company, was one of our first guinea pigs to test the software. From their use, we realised that we needed the idea of teams, to allow people to be in more than one team and view different schedules.</p>

<p>An obvious type of feature in a team scheduling app, but we kept to our simplicity philosophy and only added it when we needed to. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">Keeping things simple</a> helped to manage scope creep, and especially for such a small team, it was necessary to keep things realistically doable.</p>

<h2>Bump!</h2>

<p>Feedback is such an invaluable thing during the development process. It’s very easy to get stuck in your own head when creating something, and watching other people use your product is one of the best ways to find things you missed.</p>

<p>Amongst the development sprints, there was a dedicated sprint to user testing. We used <a href="http://silverbackapp.com/">Silverback</a> and a questionnaire on a handful of users for this. Silverback was a useful tool to see exactly how people were navigating the site, and seeing how they reacted to the different tasks. It helps so much, just being able to see people’s faces and hear what problems they encounter as they are using the app.</p>

<p>Also, a more simple method, requiring less effort was just to push the code to a server, send an email out to the office and ask for feedback. The latter shouldn’t be dismissed either, as it was equally as valuable.</p>

<p>All this feedback helped to find usability bugs, give us insight to what people thought of the app and helped find out where we should direct our attention for new features. Project view and month view came from these feedback sessions, and they’re some of our proudest features.</p>

<h2>Pop! Out she comes!</h2>

<p>It was a clean and safe birth, with all parties coming out unscathed&hellip; and now <a href="http://vistazoapp.com/">Vistazo</a> is available to the world! =)</p>

<p>It was great fun making <a href="http://vistazoapp.com/">Vistazo</a>, playing around with new technologies and learning a whole bunch about product development along the way. Please, have a play with the new kiddo, and if you have any feedback or suggestions, send them our way at <a href="mailto:vistazo@pebblecode.com">vistazo@pebblecode.com</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
