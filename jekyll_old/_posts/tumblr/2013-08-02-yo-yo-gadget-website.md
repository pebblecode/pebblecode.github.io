<p>I’ve been looking around for a website template generator for a while, and finally got round to creating one - <a href="https://github.com/taktran/generator-starttter">generator-starttter</a> (<a href="https://npmjs.org/package/generator-starttter">npm</a>) using <a href="http://yeoman.io/generators.html">yeoman generators</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I had taken the approach of cloning my <a href="https://github.com/taktran/starttter">starttter</a> boilerplate git repo, removing the <code>.git</code> folder and hacking from there (similar to what <a href="http://blog.pebblecode.com/blog/generating-boilerplate-sites-for-experimentation-with">Mark blogged about</a>). I knew that there were better ways, especially with all these new snazzy javascript tools around, but just hadn’t found the time to figure them out.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="https://plus.google.com/101063139999404044459/posts/A4F6VQuRDAU">yeoman 1.0</a> recently got released, and the <a href="http://yeoman.io/generators.html">generators</a> part of the project really caught my eye, making it fairly easy to create your own generator. I also like <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/The-Road-to-1.0">the direction yeoman is going</a>, separating out yo (previously yeoman), grunt and bower, for scaffolding, build/test tooling and dependency management respectively.</p>

<p>We previously used yeoman in the <a href="http://100campaign.org/">100 campaign</a>, but had some gripes with it being such a behemoth of a tool and doing too many things with not much flexibility. However, with 1.0 it feels a lot more modular, and easier to pick and choose whichever parts are relevant to your project. It’s also real nice that you can add prompts when generating, so you can do things like conditionally install <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a>, or add a name to your website in the generated files (which is what I have done). You’re basically only limited by your javascript skills.</p>

<p>To get the generator running you just need to</p>

<ol><li>Make sure you have <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yo">yo</a> installed: <code>npm install -g yo</code></li>
<li>Install the generator: <code>npm install -g generator-starttter</code></li>
<li><p>Generate starttter website (assuming you are in the directory you want to generate in):</p>

<pre><code>yo starttter
</code></pre></li>
</ol><p>It did take an afternoon to setup the generator, but now that it’s setup, it’ll help with programmer flow when starting new projects and random hacks. Feel free to play around: <a href="https://github.com/taktran/generator-starttter">https://github.com/taktran/generator-starttter</a>, or create your own <a href="http://yeoman.io/generators.html">generator</a>!</p>
