<p>We have finally found the time to release Tricklr - an app we have had in the works for a while. </p>

<p>Tricklr solves the annoying problem of being continuously active on Twitter without having to stop 10 times a day to think about writing a tweet. Now, you can write lots of tweets in a oner and they will just <i>trickl</i> out at a pace you set. </p>

<p>Tricklr is a very simple app and we hope that you like it! There are a couple of screenshots below, but probably best to just go and <a href="http://tricklrapp.com">try it out</a>!
