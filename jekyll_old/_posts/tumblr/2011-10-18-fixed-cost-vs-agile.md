<p>For some time now, we have been debating whether to even entertain clients asking for a fixed price contract. Generally, it is only really possible to accurately predict the necessary time to complete a project if the project is small or extensively specified. Small projects are rarely profitable and often just get in the way. Highly specified projects are often subject to so much change throughout the lifecycle of the project, that you generally end up going over budget and deadline in the end anyway. </p>

<p>In comes agile. With an agile project, we can work closely with the client in defined &lsquo;sprints&rsquo; to complete priority functionality first - constantly reviewing the output to ensure that the end product is exactly what the client wants - not what they <i>thought</i> they wanted. It is actually much easier to work to a predefined budget on an agile project. If it is a big enough project then the client needs to be looking to ongoing development and maintenance anyway. </p>

<p>As an example, the last couple of projects that we have worked on, we have walked away with some very satisfied clients having come in on time and under budget. We are happy as we have been paid for all the work that we have done. Client is happy as they have what they want, when they wanted it and for the right amount of money. </p>

<p>The last fixed price project we did, we came close to dropping the project because insufficient upfront analysis proved that the data migration phase significantly over ran due to the complexity of the task. Client obviously not happy as we were behind schedule. We were not happy as the project did not make any profit. In this example, it was our fault as we should have done more up front analysis, but the client did not want to pay for the analysis and we wanted the work. Lesson learned! </p>

<p>To conclude, pebble will now only take on agile work and are confident that we can explain the mutual benefits to future clients - even if it takes a little persuasion! </p>

<p>Got thoughts on this topic - let us have 'em&hellip;</p>
