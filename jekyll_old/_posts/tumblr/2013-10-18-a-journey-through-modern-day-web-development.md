<p>I did a presentation about things going on in modern day web development, last night at the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/series/london-d3-js/">london d3 meetup</a>.</p>

<p>It was a great opportunity to explore and jot down some of things I&rsquo;ve been following and thinking about anyway, and present some of the things I&rsquo;ve done. Also learnt the hard way, how live demos can fail ;) Note to self, set up bigger font and a white background terminal/text editor <em>before</em> the presentation&hellip;or just don&rsquo;t do live demos (I do enjoy seeing things in action though).</p>

<p>In retrospect, I would have spent more time on the fun things, like no backend visualisations and hardware, rather than the fluffy stuff, which felt like preaching to the converted anyway. Maybe next time!</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="http://slid.es/taktran/modern-day-web-dev">slides</a> for those interested:</p>
