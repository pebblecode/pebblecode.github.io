<p>Tricklr&rsquo;s previous UI was developed &lsquo;old school&rsquo; - the design was mocked up in Photoshop, all the relevant images were ripped and then the styling was approximated in css.</p>
<p>When we started the redesign, we decided to to try a new approach to the design and implementation. Here’s a run down of what we did and why we think the new approach was a success.</p>
<p>We started off by creating a separate style guide that could be applied to all of the elements in the app. To start, we created a simple .html doc containing all the elements we needed to style. We tried to give all elements class names that were as generic as possible (about 60% of the elements have the class button).</p>

<p>With this blank canvas ready, we started to style each element. Most of the styling was done ‘in browser’ using css3 goodness, but there was also quite a lot of Photoshop / Illustrator work done at this stage for things like the tiling background and working out colours for gradients.</p>

<p>We also made a folder of tiling noise .pngs of different opacities - this let us add different amounts of noise to different elements without having to keep going back and forth between css and Photoshop each time. If you’d like to use the same set up for your designs you can download it <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14876849/noise-pngs.zip" title="noise pngs" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>Once happy with the style guide, we (the developers) started adding the styles to the app. We used <a href="http://compass-style.org/" title="Compass" target="_blank">compass</a> to handle all the vendor prefixes which made dealing with all the nice css3 stuff that much easier.</p>
<p>After all the styles were in the app we found a few small bugs and made some tweaks here and there, mostly to do with positioning rather than style.</p>
<p>Now you might be asking yourself why bother with creating a style guide when you could just style the app in browser and have the same effect? Here are a few reasons why we think it’s worth adding that extra step:</p>
<ul><li>When your not worried about anything linking up or having any functionality you can focus purely on the UI.</li>
<li>Separating design elements from the app as a whole helped us keep similar elements consistent.</li>
<li>Designers can work on the UI whilst developers work on functionality without getting in each others way.</li>
<li>You can see all the elements for the entire app on one page rather than having to switch pages to check out what’s what. This also lets you see how the UI works as a whole rather than for each page.</li>
</ul><p>Overall it’s probably slightly more time consuming to do things this way but you get a better result. The design we ended up with really succeeds because everything with the UI is coherent and that’s a direct result of taking the time to design the style guide.</p>
