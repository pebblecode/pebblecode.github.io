<p>Occasionally, from somewhere in the pebble code office, you&rsquo;ll hear the alarm cry of &lsquo;Management Coding!&rsquo;. This is generally in response to a member of our management team deciding to get their hands dirty and either play with some code or try to offer some advice on how to approach a coding problem. Whilst we have a fairly technically able group of managers, it&rsquo;s generally agreed that they should keep their minds focused on the business, and not fiddle with the intricate workings of our systems and applications, and for a simple reason: they&rsquo;re not developers.</p>
<p class="p2">Having worked with developers for some time, both at pebble and in previous roles, I&rsquo;ve started to understand the way they work, and how to work with them without being a hindrance. Not to say that I always get it right, but there&rsquo;s certainly approaches that work and others that most definitely do not. Here&rsquo;s a couple of lessons I&rsquo;ve learnt over time:</p>
<h3>Context Switching</h3>
<p class="p1">Probably the biggest time vacuum of a developers day. We&rsquo;re all in the same room, and it&rsquo;s very easy for a project manager or non-developer to saunter over to one of the development team and ask them a question. Or ask them to take a look at a bug. Or ask them to update the project management tool we use (<a title="Pivotal Tracker" target="_self" href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com">pivotaltracker.com</a>). Our developers, being the polite, helpful people they are, will invariably stop whatever it is they&rsquo;re doing and help. In doing this, I have essentially interrupted their workflow. They have had to go from debugging production logs in terminal to deal with whatever might have been asked of them, and then switch back. Whilst it may have been only a minute or two of distraction, they&rsquo;ve inevitably lost their chain of thought and have to spend some time getting back into whatever it was that they were doing. There&rsquo;s a net loss of time in this scenario.</p>
<p class="p2">The most productive developers are those that are left to work their magic in discrete blocks of time, with no interruption or switching of context. Ideally, a developer should be allowed to work in blocks of half days or more. It&rsquo;s better for them and it&rsquo;s better for projects as whole. It&rsquo;s up to their managers and those around them to ensure they&rsquo;re given the time and space to do this.</p>
<h3>Prioritisation and Deadlines</h3>
<p class="p1">A complex project may mean a developer is working for several months on one system. They may have 100 features to build in this time. They will see it as their baby. They&rsquo;ve built it from the ground up and should take a lot of pride in their creation. As a result, they will seek perfection in small details. That&rsquo;s commendable, and results in some beautiful work. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s probably the second biggest cause of missed deadlines, after scope creep. </p>
<p class="p2">It is largely down to the project manager to keep on top of which features have been completed and ensure the priorities and deadlines are communicated well. Not that we want to discourage a developer taking time to include great looking layouts and neat javascript transitions, but those shouldn&rsquo;t take precedence over writing proper tests and ensuring key functionality works as expected. If left to their own devices, a developer could get caught up the finer detail, and those little touches which the client will probably never even notice. Just as with building a house, you should make sure the roof is on before you start painting the bedroom.</p>
<h3>Understanding the work</h3>
<p class="p1">As mentioned in the opening paragraph, I like to think we&rsquo;ve got some fairly savvy managers in the pebble code team. Whilst we&rsquo;re not developers, we try to understand what our guys are doing. Some of us may have taken the time to learn a little RoR or HTML. Some of us could probably even put together a simple content site without breaking too much of a sweat. That said, we have to be reminded to stick to what we&rsquo;re good at and let the developers do the same. </p>
<p class="p2">This little bit of insight can be useful in a different way - when scoping a project or trying to help clients articulate their requirements, a simple understanding of how a developer is likely to approach the problem will go a long way. As a result, we&rsquo;re less likely to promise a client we can build a complex feature in 3 days and then present the developers with a insurmountable task and unachievable deadline. There&rsquo;s even been the odd occasion, when looking over a developer&rsquo;s shoulder, that a PM has spotted the typo that led to 2 hours of debugging, but that&rsquo;s rarer than hen&rsquo;s teeth and likely to trigger a cry of 'Management Coding&rsquo; from across the room swiftly followed by a nerf dart to the back of the head&hellip;</p>
