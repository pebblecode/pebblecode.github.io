<p>I’m pleased to be able to reveal another of great results of our recent hack day on the theme of education, codenamed “Assessment Anywhere”!</p>
<p>The aim was to reduce some of the difficulties surrounding teachers&rsquo; time-consuming marking processes. Our idea was to automate the assignment of grade boundaries and calculate student statistics without spreadsheets. </p>
<p>The team, consisting of me and Karen Williams, with UX help from John Mildinhall, managed to deliver a functional application meeting these requirements by the end of the hack day. </p>
<p>After the hack day, I took this project on as a personal project in my own time, getting it ready to put in front of teachers to gather some real-world feedback. We have chosen to concentrate on the core features, and will be adding the statistics features at a later date. It is available for live demonstration at <a href="http://assessment-anywhere.apphb.com/" title="Assessment Anywhere Demonstration">assessment-anywhere.apphb.com</a></p>
<p>We would like to be able to put even more development time behind Assessment Anywhere. This will allow us to take it in exciting new directions.  We recently applied for funding from the IC Tomorrow programme. Check out our two minute video pitch below!</p>
