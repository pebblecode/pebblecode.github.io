<p>Last week, we at pebble {code} had the exciting opportunity to take part in Lloyds bank Innovation Jam. Lloyds is a highly respected banking institution in the UK, and has been a constant on our high streets for 140 years, with over 16 million retail and small business customers.<!-- more --></p>
<p>In spite of this, Lloyds recognises that for a retail bank to succeed in the 21st century, they need to become a digital bank that also has a physical presence. Right now they are a physical bank that also has an online presence.</p>

<p><span>Innovation in retail banking is not easy. Banks deal with a vast amount of highly sensitive data, and their customers value business continuity, reliability and predictability in their provider. However, banking customers are experiencing vast improvement in digital experiences in huge swathes of their lives, and are beginning to demand the same advances in their banking. Why should it be so difficult to perform simple banking activities?</span></p>

<p><span>These are some of the challenges that the Innovation Jam set out to solve. The jam had a mix of people from business and technology, as well as external agencies such as pebble {code}. It sought to use the hackathon methodology to find new ways to provide value to their customers.</span></p>

<p><em>Mark - one of our designers - rethought of a high-profile brand: Lloyds becomes a startup</em></p>
<p><span>We were proud to be able to work with representatives from Lloyds to create new prototypes. Everyone from pebble {code} created working software that was demonstrated at the end of the hack. We were very excited that one of our developers - Daniel Bradley - won the technical prize for most impressive technology implementation. His app allowed small business owners to manage the flow of cash through their business much more effectively. This was an app that solved a real business need both for Lloyds and their customers, and did so with a considerable degree of flair.</span></p>
<p><span>This is an outstanding example of how large businesses can benefit from the culture and methods of hack days to provide quantum leaps in their technology offerings. Everyone present was given enormous food for thought, and left considerably enlightened as to what banking could become if innovation is given the chance to flourish.</span></p>
