<p>Today we are proud to release our latest bouncing baby to the public.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m29f567g0p1qz7kgs.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>Vistazo is a lightweight web application to help small teams keep track of who is working on what and when they are working on it.</p>

<p>We created Vistazo to solve a problem we were having at the pebble {code} office with keeping track of what everyone was working on. We found the available solutions for team/time management were far too complex for our needs, often adding in a ton of functionality that we really didn’t need. Just like any other great software company when we discovered the right tool for us didn’t exist, we decided to build our own.</p>

<p>We’ve been using (and loving) Vistazo internally for a few months and now we&rsquo;re at a stage where we’re happy to share it with the public.</p>

<p>Vist vistazoapp.com to try it out for yourself.</p>

<p>Any feedback you have about it is greatly received, so please get in touch if you have any issues, would like to request a feature, or preferably just to tell us how much you love Vistazo!</p>
