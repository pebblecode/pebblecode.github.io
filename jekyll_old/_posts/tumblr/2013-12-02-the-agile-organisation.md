<p><a href="http://raconteur.net/the-agile-business">November’s Raconteur “The Agile Business”</a> has a great opening piece extensively quoting Layla Ford from Envato on agile organisations. Reading through I found myself comparing this high level agile overview with the experiences we’ve had with Agile at pebble {code}, but also considering the first steps a business can take in beginning to embed an Agile culture. The article quotes the following definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>Agile is just a set of repeatable methods for achieving something.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>I tend to think this loose definition is somewhat misleading. At pebble we believe that Agile is more of a mindset than a particular set of methods. It’s more than simply iterating your way towards a desired project goal, it’s the embracing of uncertainty and the constant re-evaluation of your assumptions with a view to edging ever closer to your vision.</p>

<p>As a software business we’ve flirted with most of the concrete Agile software practices at one time or another. Each one describes a set of processes to book-end iterative development approaches with a thin layer of goal focussed project management. Fine, but the real challenge for any business is how to embed an Agile culture across the entire organisation. This is where the big wins are yet to be had. How to get employees considering each of the decisions they make in the context of the company’s strategic vision?</p>

<p>I think any definition of Agile that doesn’t include the word “Vision” misses the point. The key to embracing an Agile culture as a business is accepting that the interpretation of vision changes over time. I agree with Layla Ford’s analysis that Agile switches the focus from deliverables to outcomes. The part of becoming an Agile organisation is an implicit admission that perfection is out of reach most of the time - there is no “<a href="http://accurev.com/blog/2013/08/26/when-is-software-really-done/">Done Done</a>&ldquo; for the organisation.</p>

<p>In any complex self-organising system, there are always tweaks to be made, improvements that better serve the organisational goals - as soon as your organisation gets anywhere near to that vision, you can bet the interpretation of that vision will have already changed.</p>

<p>Accepting this constant, subtle moving of the goal posts is at the heart of organisational adaptation of Agile. It’s completely at odds with the classic strategic outputs for running a company. Financial plans that attempt to predict the next five years of revenue; hiring strategies that map out the next 20 positions you need to fill (when the organisation has a a head count of 15); rigid HR hierarchies. These are all indicators that a company is poorly suited to embracing the uncertainty that an Agile organisation is poised to exploit.</p>

<p>So how does an organisation start to use Agile principles?</p>

<p>How to embrace uncertainty and embark upon the ever changing but never boring road towards your vision?</p>

<p>Start by recognising that <strong>your employees are more important than your customers</strong>. Without them, your products and services are irrelevant, and only through them can you ever hope to improve your outputs and deliver customer value. Empowering employees to understand your vision for the company is the starting point for any business attempting to adapt an agile approach. This means sharing the vision and information about the business with them. Be open.</p>

<p>Next up, <strong>start measuring</strong>. Defining metrics for success that allow you to measure progress are the only way to evaluate whether the changes you’ve made have had an effect. For a commercial strategy, this means cold hard cash. For a website improvement project, Google Analytics data is a good starting point.</p>

<p><strong>Break down communications barriers</strong>. Does every employee in the business feel empowered to walk up to your CEO and make a suggestion about the business? If not, why not? How often do directors speak to foot soldiers about what the business could be doing better? If the answer to this isn’t ‘regularly’ there are serious questions to be asked.</p>

<p><strong>Start trying new things</strong> - define time frames for your experiments, and think about success criteria and metrics before you kick off. Share the results, whether they’re good or bad. Embrace failure - every time you try something that doesn’t work you’ve moved your learning forwards.</p>
