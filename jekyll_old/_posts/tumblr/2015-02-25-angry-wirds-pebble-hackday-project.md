For my first Pebble Hackday, I thought I&rsquo;d try and see what unique skills I could bring to the table; a hard job given that Pebble has the cream-of-the-crop in developers and designers.

With my background in motion design and creative coding, I thought I&rsquo;d try and focus just on a technique for Visualising rather than the Visualisation itself.</p><p>Thinking about how I could visualise data in a new (and more importantly, beautiful) way, I moved to thinking about text and generative typography.</p><p>While text is arguably the most direct method to get a message across (whether it&rsquo;s data or not), the inherent need for readability means that visually the letters can often be a little flat and one dimensional.<br/>Not always conveying the emotional depth of the content.</p><p>As web typography comes of age, maybe it&rsquo;s worth asking if we can create type experiments along the line of guys like <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=david+carson&amp;es_sm=91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6rzYVMWZOcrcaonEgPAL&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1285&amp;bih=970&amp;dpr=2">David Carson</a>, and how dynamic media can bring new approaches.</p><p>I decided to create letterforms that have this extra dimension, reflecting the emotional content of the prose.<br/>I wanted to makeÂ angry words looks visually &lsquo;angry&rsquo;, and likewise for friendly words.</p><p>To give a usable example; A block of data depicting customer reviews could display particularly negative reviews as sharp angular letters, making the rage of the customer a lot more apparent.</p><p>Animated typography already has a history (Websites like <a href="http://animography.net/">animography</a> do this very well), but playing back animations or displaying images would be too easy (this was a hackday after all, a time for experimenting).<br/>I decided to to generate the letters programatically, and I wanted to use the day to get better acquainted with paper.js, a javascript library for vector drawing that I&rsquo;d only skimmed over previously.</p><p>A few sketches later, I had decided to start with the basics; A simple letter 'A&rsquo;, and designing the binary emotions of happiness and anger, imagining gentle floating outline for the former and sharp, jarring outline for the latter.<br/>I broke the letter down into a series of points, where I could place shapes at each point.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;happy&rdquo; letter would have circles that gently pulsed giving a cloud-like appearance,<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Angry&rdquo; letter would have sharp rectangles that vibrated randomly giving a sharp, scratchy look.<br/><br/>I imagined a sliding scale between these two states, with other behaviours available at a later date (Sad words could droop, scared words could shake).<br/>If the letter was distilled into points, then their behaviour could take many forms.<br/><br/></p><figure><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/6131ca20fa034be688b030878955b992/tumblr_inline_njiij3EmBJ1rvocwd.jpg" alt="image"/></figure><p><br/>After building the 'happy A&rsquo; shape out of circles, then making the 'angry&rsquo; shape out of rectangles, I focussed on how to move between them and hit an unexpected stumbling block.<br/><br/>I imagined paperJS would have an easy function to switch between rectangles and circles, or to allow me to 'round off&rsquo; a rectangle to look like a circle.<br/>Unfortunately it didn&rsquo;t..<br/>There was only a one-way process to 'smooth&rsquo; rectangles to round their corners.<br/><br/>Running a little short of time, I elected to stick to my original intention of creating something beautiful, and focussed on the A and B, finessing them rather than focus on the whole alphabet.</p><p>All in all, I like what I made.<br/>The letters look nice, and I feel I&rsquo;ve made a good starting point to build on for further experiments.<br/>I&rsquo;m hoping to get some time going forward to re-visit this experiment and accomplish what I originally intended.<br/><br/>The eventual aim would be to give the app a string (&ldquo;Welcome back&rdquo; / &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo;) and it be displayed accordingly, with the sentiment analysis either happening in the app or externally.<br/><br/>Looking forward to more Pebble Hackdays!<br/><br/>P.S a hat tip must go to Jesse Zwaan for the name of the project.<br/><br/></p>
