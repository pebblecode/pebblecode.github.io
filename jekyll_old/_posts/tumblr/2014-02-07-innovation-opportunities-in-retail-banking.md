<p>pebble {code} is a place awash with ideas. We look at traditional industries and see a wealth of opportunities for disruption from technology. We have written a short report on areas within Retail Banking where we see potential for technology to offer consumers better customer experiences.</p>

<p>We see four major areas that will shape the direction of customer experiences in Retail Banking:</p>

<ul><li>Mobile</li>
<li>Open Data</li>
<li>Data Mining</li>
<li>The rise of cryptocurrencies</li>
</ul><p>The report <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/pebblecode.com/document/d/10ulGhZdQsxbHHnBwd-wGBYG9rt8gIIibEIrwTdXqoFw/edit">Innovation Opportunities in Retail Banking</a> is available for free.</p>
