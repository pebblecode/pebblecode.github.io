<p>pebble embarks on another day of hacks, this time with an educational theme. Follow the jump for the blow-by-blow action.</p>

<p><strong>7.30pm / The End / Pub</strong></p>
<p>And keypads down! Presentations started at about 7:15pm with five different teams showing off their hacks. Some great ideas and as ever we have been astounded at the quality and quantity of great things that can be created in just 11 hours. </p>
<p>Each team has been tasked with writing a blog post on their hack and we will add links to them here as they appear. The hacks were:</p>
<ul><li>EduPath</li>
<li>ThinkSprints</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.pebblecode.com/blog/hack-day-project-knowledge-is-free-again">KnowledgeIsFreeAgain</a></li>
<li>AssessmentsAnywhere</li>
<li>Lectr</li>
<li>CodeShare</li>
</ul><p>Thank you again to all those that took part - was a lot of fun and I know that we are all looking forward to the next one already. Now, off to the pub!</p>
<p><strong>6.30pm</strong></p>
<p>Last update before presentations in 30 minutes. We have one team so ready that they&rsquo;re adding last minute features (&ldquo;This needs video chat!&rdquo;), others rushing to have something presentable before 7pm. It&rsquo;s tense, but luckily there&rsquo;s beer and pizza. Too much pizza in fact.</p>

<p><strong>5pm</strong></p>
<p>Crunch time approaches! 2 hours remaining before presentations, pizza and beer at 7pm. The vibe is good. We’re seeing a range of different levels of progress across the teams. More functional prototypes are appearing, though some teams are still deep in code.</p>
<p>These things tend to come together in the final moments - we’re excited to see the fruits of our labours!</p>

<p><strong>1pm</strong></p>
<p>Lunch done. Teams are back at work. The ‘ThinkSprint’ team are making progress with animated sprites, the UX design for ‘Kifa’ is taking shape and graphing functions being designed for ‘Education Pathways’. Some great preview screens to see!</p>
