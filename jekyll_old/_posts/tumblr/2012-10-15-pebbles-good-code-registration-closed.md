<p>As posted a few weeks back, pebble {code} is offering one month of free service to a charitable / not-for-profit organisation&hellip; project: <b>pebble’s good {code}</b>. The registration deadline was last Friday 11th October - thank you to all those that have applied.</p>

<p>We have received loads of great applications and will be deciding on which project to pursue by the end of this week, Friday 19th October. </p>

<p><b>What are the winning characteristics?</b></p>

<ul><li>Deliverable in a month and by the end of the year</li>
<li>Something new that offers real value to the organisation</li>
<li>Lends itself well to open source - we want other organisations to be able to benefit from the work too</li>
<li>Fun to solve! ;-)</li>
</ul><p>We’re aiming to start and complete this project before the end of the year and will update progress here on the blog. </p>

<p>Excited!</p>
