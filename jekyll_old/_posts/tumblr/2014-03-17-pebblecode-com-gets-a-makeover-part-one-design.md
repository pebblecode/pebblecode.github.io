<p>Recently here at pebble HQ we’ve been working hard on an update to <a href="http://pebblecode.com/">pebblecode.com</a>. Now that it’s been released we thought it would be great to talk about the design process as well as explaining the tech involved.</p>

<p>One of the key motivating factors for the redesign was to bring the pebble {code} and pebble.it brands closer together. We’ll be releasing an updated site for our sister company int he future so stay glued to <a href="http://pebbleit.com/">pebbleit.com</a> for updates.</p>

<p>We also wanted to showcase our new focus on hack-days and make it as easy as possible for prospective clients to book hack-days with us.
This post is going to focus on the design process for the new site. You can read about the development process and the tech used in a separate post <a href="http://blog.pebblecode.com/blog/pebblecode-com-gets-a-makeover-part-two-development">here</a>.</p>

<h3>the pebble brand</h3>

<p>Before we started looking at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/">pebblecode.com</a> the design team first looked at the pebble {code} brand as a whole.</p>

<p>The pebble {code} logo was slightly revamped. Our logo is set in the excellent <a href="https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/meta">FF Meta</a> by Erik Spiekermann. With the previous logo we made some edits to make the type more geometric. This was definitely a mistake. We are now using an un-edited version of FF Meta that looks much better and is more closely aligned with the pebble.it logo (also set in meta).</p>

<p>We have also made some changes to the pebble {code} colour palette. When the previous version of the site was released we used six colours interchangeably and had no single primary brand colour. Over time we naturally started to favour ‘pebble pink’ in brand assets. We’ve now made this change official focusing on ‘pebble pink’ (#ED4F7E) but still using the other 5 colours for accents.</p>

<h3>pebblecode.com</h3>

<p>Visually the site is very much inspired by the work of iconic graphic designer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass">Saul Bass</a>. This direction is all thanks to our new designer Nancy Lee. She created some amazing illustrations for the <a href="http://pebblecode.com/work">work page</a> which had the bold flat colours and irregular lines that are often associated with Saul Bass’s work. We decided to carry this style over to all elements of the site.</p>

<p>Type choices for the site were similarly bold. We use <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/brandon-grotesque">Brandon Grotesque</a> for our headers and <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/museo-sans">Museo Sans</a> for our body copy. We chose Museo Sans for it’s excellent legibility and professional yet friendly character. For our headers we wanted something with a high impact to work with our stripped down approach. We settled on Brandon Grotesque and we love the way it works in all caps.</p>

<p>The new site also feels much more dynamic than the previous redesign because of our judicious use of animation. Good examples of this are the hover states for menu items, the contact panel sliding up and the call to action on the homepage. We’re using the amazing power of CSS transforms and transitions here and there will be more on this in the technical post to follow.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re incredibly happy with the look and feel of the new site and how it showcases pebble’s creativity and attention to detail. We’d love to hear what you think, love the site or hate it? Let us know on Twitter.</p>
