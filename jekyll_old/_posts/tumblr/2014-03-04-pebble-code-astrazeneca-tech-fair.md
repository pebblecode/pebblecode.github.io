<p><span>The other week pebble {code} was lucky enough to be invited to the AstraZeneca Tech Fair, in Cambridge.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/1d3ae7e3026d99b44a96a96b3e13db57/tumblr_inline_n1wof8aiFR1svon23.jpg"/></span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>It was a great to be chosen as one of the most exciting and innovative companies in the tech space, sharing the room with great companies like Google, Samsung, Intel, Microsoft and Huddle. There was lots of great tech on display, and we were delighted to have an opportunity to fly the pebble {code} drone!</span></p>

<p><span>All of the other companies were action-focused, and there were some impressive offerings. We were the only service company present. This significant difference gave us considerable pause for thought. The success of these big tech companies is clear to all, so why should there be a place for smaller custom houses like us?</span></p>
<p><span> Fortunately, there were over one hundred and fifty senior IT leaders from the FTSE 100 company there to help us answer that question. We learned that there are five good reasons why there is a place for the little guys like us:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span></span><strong><em>Lightweight</em></strong><span>. Quite often a business requires a very small but essential feature set. Software companies that build products to be sold to multiple customers are forced to try to cater for a wide range of potential use cases. In the case of custom software only the features that are absolutely necessary are included. This results in lightweight software that is easy to learn and maintain.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span></span><strong><em>Agility</em></strong><span>. Using the Agile software development methodology means being able to quickly adapt to changes in requirements. We all know how requirements can change. Traditional software procurement can take a long time. One particular implementation that we are aware of in this space has taken over eight years for an off-the-shelf product. And this was considered a success. Just think of what has occurred in tech in that time – eight years ago there were no iPhones, no iPads and Windows XP was still relatively new. Businesses simply cannot afford these days to have such a slow software development cycle.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span></span><strong><em>Security</em></strong><span>. A huge proportion of business software is now delivered in the cloud. Feedback we frequently hear is that it is not transparent where the client data is held. If you are a software idealist, you may not think that matters: surely it is the point of the cloud that mirroring data all over the world increases reliability and decreases response times. The issue is that many businesses are required to guarantee the security of their data. Many of the large cloud SaaS providers are unable to specify where their customers’ data will be held. This is a big problem.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, recent developments in the security space have highlighted that some of the private fibre networks of large tech businesses are non-encrypted. There are no guarantees that this has been fixed, and the result is that you really have no idea what happens to your data the moment you let it out of your door. Developing custom software allows you a much greater degree of control over what you do with your data. Businesses are starting to realise that they cannot simply sit back and say to themselves ‘I’m sure it’s fine, these are all well known and respected companies’.  </span></p>
<p><span></span><strong><em>Ultra-specification</em></strong><span>. Building custom software allows you to make design choices that are not available to customers of off-the-shelf or customised software. As a simple example, suppose you have a specific way of viewing financial data in your company. A vendor of off-the-shelf software will try to persuade you that their way of viewing the financial data is better. This may or may not be the case, but what they will not factor in with their arguments are the costs of the changes to the business aside from the software. Think of the training to help people to adapt, the incompatibility with other systems. It can be a lot more expensive than you initially believe to have your organisation change.</span></p>
<p><span>With custom-built software, you have the opportunity to deliver to your users the experience and functionality that they truly need. You can reduce training costs to a negligible level and seamlessly interface with your existing systems.</span></p>
<p><span></span><strong><em>Culture</em></strong><span>. Having the ability quickly to create small and lightweight apps empowers your organisation. If a prototype solution can be created in a matter of two weeks, it reinforces a ‘can-do’ attitude in the organisation. Bureaucracy is diminished because large, traditional tendering processes are unnecessary. For a fraction of the price, a first version can be produced. This allows feedback to be quickly taken on board, and means that the organisation can stay competitive and jump on innovative ideas quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span>Organisations are under pressure to demonstrate their ability to deliver technological innovation. More and more companies are discovering that by the time their requirements filter through to providers of off-the-shelf software, they have often lost a competitive edge – simply because the solution is available to all. We at pebble {code} are proud to be one of the little guys delivering that innovation for large businesses.</span></p>
