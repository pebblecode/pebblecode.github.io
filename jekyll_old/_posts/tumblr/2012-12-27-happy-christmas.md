<br/><p>2012 has been a great year for pebble {code} - lots of <a href="http://pebblecode.com/people">new faces</a> and lots of new exciting work opportunities. As we now near 2013, we have reviewed the goods, the bads and the uglies and set ourselves some new targets and objectives for the year ahead - and very excited about it we are too! </p>

<p>In summary, we have two potential new clients hopefully starting in the new year and have already started organising our next hack day which will be in February, theme: Education. If you have any thoughts or ideas, let us know. </p>

<p>There is talk of a new office space, but that is more likely to be Q2. </p>

<p>Please stay tuned for more information on what we&rsquo;re up to and what we&rsquo;re interested in. <strong>Wishing everyone a very Happy Christmas and all the best for the New Year</strong>. </p>
