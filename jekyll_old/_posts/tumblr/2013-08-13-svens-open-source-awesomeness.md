<p>Here at pebble HQ we&rsquo;re keen supporters of open source software. Many of our developers contribute to open source projects but we&rsquo;d like to make a special mention one of our developers.</p>

<p><a href="http://pebblecode.com/people/sven-lito">Sven Lito</a> has just been added to the core team of both <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> and <a href="http://hood.ie/">Hoodie!</a></p>

<p>The Hoodie team recently interviewed Sven for their blog. If you&rsquo;d like to know a little bit more about Sven and Hoodie check out the blog post <a href="http://blog.hood.ie/2013/08/meet-the-hoodies-episode-1-sven/">here</a>.</p>
