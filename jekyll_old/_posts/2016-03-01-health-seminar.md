On 25th February, [pebble {code}][1] facilitated a breakfast seminar on Innovation in Healthcare.

Our company has worked in this sector for a number of years now, and it's a topic we feel passionate about. This was a chance for us to gain a deeper understanding of the problems facing the industry from a number of experts in the field. After listening to an excellent keynote speech, we discussed both the potential opportunities, and the unavoidable pitfalls of trying to use technology to transform the healthcare system.

## Issues surrounding the NHS

The NHS is often discussed as a single body, but it is made up of thousands of organisations, that adapt their working processes to suit their individual needs. To try and standardise even a small part of this system across the country is a complex task, fraught with nuances between different CCGs, hospitals and even wards.

On top of this, the biggest driver of cost in the NHS is the long-term care of the elderly, representing two thirds of the total cost. This demographic is not technology literate so how do we innovate here? Is technology even appropriate for this demographic?

Security of patient information is also a factor, and any digital products need to account for information governance, confidentiality and consent.

## Digital Competence

It is not just the elderly patients where technology is an issue. Digital competence amongst Senior Leaders can be a problem. Many are in their 40s and 50s and lack the experience to understand the morphing digital landscape. 

Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the web is favoured as a platform over native apps, due to limited space on phones, and a lack of appetite to download content.

## Lead by example

There are clearly challenges to overcome, but there is also evidence that high quality consumer-grade apps can change behaviours just by being useful to users. Adoption will happen organically without training or mandating, when the right tool is created. [MedShr][2] is an exemplar on how to create a consumer-grade app in Healthcare, with strong governance on User Interface and User Experience design.

## Propelling Innovation


Innovation efforts can be propelled by proposing a hypothesis, measuring it in a quantitative way and learning from the outcome. The NHS already has proven that they can use [AB testing to reduce costs significantly][3] with almost no investment required.

Unfortunately it seems that very few people are practicing bottom-up innovation and co-design with doctors or patients. How can we educate key decision makers to be able to make good decisions on Innovation? This doesn't just mean knowing how to build the right thing, or how to scale that to a national or global level when it has demonstrative value for patient outcomes, but also how to [embrace failure][4], and cut a project when not proving successful. Who gets to make these decisions? Is it down to the GPs? Should the market decide?


## Improving Communication

There are communication challenges in Health Innovation. We need to figure out how to persuade patients to change behaviours, and do this while ensuring confidence in confidentiality and security. We can't do this without engaging with the right people - accessing the support of both medics and patients. But whom do we start with?

We have a long way to go in answering all the questions that this seminar provoked. But at least the conversation has been started, and everyone in attendance agreed it was a valuable experience. We realised that as a group we must focus on key issues, while involving Doctors and Nurses in the field. 

The team at [pebble {code}][1] don't know exactly what is going to happen next, but we do know we're excited by it!
