How do we manage resource scarcity in the 21st century? As modern humans, could we ever replicate the survival capabilities of our ancestors, and will technology ever reach the point where scarcity is a thing of the past?

Avid watchers of Bear Grylls’ ‘The Island’ will no doubt have joined me in frustration, as the seemingly intelligent, enthusiastic, but ultimately incapable castaways scramble around a tropical paradise for 6 weeks, attempting to survive without access to the modern comforts we take for granted.

“I could do better” - the thought constantly running through my mind during each episode. The islanders fail to catch fish from the seemingly bounteous pacific ocean (and the edit suggests they try for maybe an hour every other day before giving up). Hunting seems like an activity they only consider after spending an entire day trying to construct a twig bed.

The reality is that I’m no more suited to the trials and tribulations of island scarcity than these plucky city-dwellers, wrenched from their comfortable homes, where sourcing food is as complex as deciding whether to walk to the Tesco Metro around the corner, or jump in the car and go to the larger, better stocked Sainsburys half a mile away, where they definitely stock the Charlie Bingham Lasagne I’d quite like to stick in the oven this evening.

In our well-resourced modern lives, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is just that thing we were taught in A-Level economics two decades ago. We (living in our privileged, western world) never really consider the lowest of these levels - the "Basic needs or Physiological needs" of a human being: food, water, sleep - which are bounteous and certainly not something we have to struggle for on a daily basis, unlike our prehistoric ancestors. The Islanders themselves suddenly discover they are faced with scarcity, and without the skills or knowledge to manage, and within a fortnight are near starving, and the rescue boats are primed for intervention.

As each of our most basic needs are satisfied and scarcity is removed, we travel upwards in the hierarchy, and more of our time is devoted pursuit of the needs at the top of Malsow’s pyramid - self-actualisation: creativity; morality; spontaneity.

In our world, where scarcity of resource is our current reality, our current economic system attempts to manage decisions about how to allocate these resources efficiently, in order to satisfy the basic needs of humans, and to support as many additional ‘wants’ as possible.

Futurology (postulating possible, probable, and preferable futures) imagines a post-scarcity world - where our basic human needs are fulfilled instantly and abundantly - and humanity is able to move ever closer to a society where fulfilling the very top of Maslow’s hierarchy is allowed an ever increasing amount of our time.

Whilst that is not yet our reality, we do appear to be moving ever closer to a post-scarcity world, and if it were to become a reality, the global economy will be nearly unrecognisable - most existing business models rely entirely on scarcity, and many will be eradicated in a future utopia.

Knowledge and information is already abundant, and that’s only really become the case during the last 20 years. Encyclopedia salesmen can no longer sell their 30 volume leather bound books, when a cheap mobile device can provide access to infinitely more information, infinitely faster.

Today, 3D printing has the potential to decimate the traditional retail environment - in 2015 the US approved the first [3D printed drug](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/aug/05/the-first-3d-printed-pill-opens-up-a-world-of-downloadable-medicine), and you can purchase a 3D printer capable of [printing electronic devices](http://www.voxel8.co/) for less than $10,000. Who would go to an Apple Store to buy a phone, when an equivalent device could be printed cheaply and quickly at home, using open-source schematics?

Lab grown meat and vertical farming could simultaneously solve the world’s food crisis, and eradicate the agriculture and livestock industries.

Artificial Intelligence and Robotics will automate and eradicate huge swathes of jobs in many industries (and [they](http://www.wirelessweek.com/news/2016/05/verizon-deploys-thousands-more-workers-looks-automation-strike-wears) [already](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/automated-ports-have-dockworkers-in-the-netherlands-threatening-strikes) [are](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36306462) - shown by the growing frequency of strikes by workers replaced with drastically more efficient and cheaper robotic labour). The World Economic Forum, exploring the [Future of Jobs](http://pebblecode.com/blog/the-future-of-jobs/) identified Complex Problem Solving, Critical Thinking, and Creativity as the key skills in the workplace by 2020.

These technological changes are forcing companies to abandon traditional business models and adapt to a changing economic model - disruptive technologies in individual markets (take Uber, AirBnB, [Mondo Bank](https://getmondo.co.uk/), for example) are small steps in what may be an exponentially accelerating change in the way businesses operate, in the wider global sense. As jobs are automated and our needs, wants and priorities change, [innovation](http://pebblecode.com/blog/less-agile-more-customer/) and [digital transformation](http://pebblecode.com/blog/how-to-succeed-in-a-digital-transformation/) become an ever more important survival tactic for organisations. Those that do not adapt, that are unable to innovate quickly, will starve as they enter a world in which their business model has no place.

It’s not unthinkable to imagine that technological advancements will change the face of the planet, hopefully for the better, within the next 50 years. Science Fiction often imagines a cashless world - in Gene Roddenberry’s Star Trek Federation, personal wealth does not exist, and people voluntarily engage in activities to enrich themselves and the world around them. In Cory Doctorow’s [“Down and Out In The Magic Kingdom”](http://craphound.com/category/down/) people accumulate reputation and social capital in the form of a ['Whuffie'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whuffie) score.

Perhaps these are far fetched ideals - perhaps they are closer than we realise, but if they were to become our new reality, perhaps in 100 years, the 2116 cast of The Island would be dumped in the equivalent of today’s cash-based, semi-scare economy, and struggle with unfamiliar concepts like ‘having a job’ and ‘having to go shopping’. I think that’s one scenario where today’s modern man will feel right at home.
