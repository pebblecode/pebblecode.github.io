title: A noobs guide to solving the right problem at 3DS

### I was recently invited to facilitate a 3DS (3 Day Startup) event for students at Queen Mary University. A 3 day event for students to learn how to find out what it is people want to pay money for.

It’s a little different from Startup Weekend where the end goal is to have a working prototype they can show off to a panelist of judges.

It’s closer to the lean startup machine model where people focus on validating assumptions about their customers, customers problems, and the kind of solutions that should be built.

By the end of the event, students who have attended this event, will have learnt how to identify the real problems they need to be solving through a process of getting customer feedback, and rapidly prototyped ideas.

Solving the right problem doesn’t sound like much, but most startups fail from a lack of (paying) customers. Often this is because people are not solving the right problem and actually making something people want to pay for.

## How to solve the right problem the 3DS way
My goal as a facilitator was to help students to focus on the needs of their customers rather than fall hopelessly in love with their ideas.

Ideas are like little babies; you’ll still love them even if they are ugly or stupid, because they are your own.

The best way to do that is to talk to the people who would pay for your product and test out all the assumptions that lead you to that solution. You don’t have to trust me, or your peers, but you probably won’t get very far if you don’t listen to the people who will end up paying you.

## Customers Vs Users
It seems pretty obvious once this has been said out aloud, but frequently you’ll find people forget that there is a distinction between customers and users. To clarify:

Customers pay you
Users do not
Example: Dog Food

The customer is the dog owner
The user is the dog

In the context of something you might be more familiar with:
You are a Facebook user.
Advertisers are Facebook customers.

## Customer Validation
We used the lean canvas, a canvas to help us put some order to our ideas which will help us to better understand our base assumptions of the situation.

#### Customer segments
A narrow group of people that will buy or use your product

#### Problem
The top 3 problems the customers is facing today and how they are currently solving the problem.

#### Value proposition
Single, clear, compelling message that turns an unaware visitor into an interested prospect.

#### Solution
Defining the MVP (minimal viable product), the minimal set of functionality to solve each problem of the customers

> “Bind a solution to your problem as late as possible.” -Ash Maurya

As Ash puts it, you want to learn as much about your customers problem before crafting your solution.

## Customer Interviews
The details added into the lean canvas are not some random exercise that we do, they are there to help us understand what we think we understand about the problem and pinpoint what it is we need to confirm. If your entire solution is based on a false premise, then you will probably waste a lot of time and money building something no one really needs.

> “Customers don’t care about your solution. They care about their problems.” - Dave McClure, 500Startups

During the customer interview, there are a few key points that to look out for:

- The customers pain point. Look for big, emotional pains. People don’t take action until it really hurts.
- What doesn’t work with alternatives? Stuff they’ve already tried to solve their problem.
- How big is their problem?

What we are looking for are patterns in their responses. We don’t sell our idea here just yet. We are looking to break our hypothesis. If it looks like your hypothesis is correct, then you are probably on the right track.

“probably”

## The solutions interview
Hopefully at this point, your hypothesis has either gone through several iterations or remained the same. This in turn will likely affect your solution.

In the same way the customer interview was used to validate your problem, the solutions interview is for validating your solution. Points to look out for when talking about your solution:

- Does it solve their problem?
- How much is it work to them?
- Is it a must-have?
- Does it fit into their lives and how?

Here’s a sample script the students used to customise for their own projects:

- What’s the hardest part about [problem context] ?
- Can you tell me about the last time that happened?
- Why was that hard?
- What, if anything, have you done to solve that problem?
- What don’t you love about the solutions you’ve tried?

The customer and solutions interview process is very much like the build, measure, learn process in the learn startup. Where the MVP, is not simply a prototype, but is the cheapest solution you can use to validate an assumption.

Over the course of the 3 days, the students have come to experience the sense of dread when I approach them. They  realised quickly that I will ask them the same question over and over again:

“What's they problem you are trying to solve”

The students that participated in the 3 day workshop did an amazing job. Some ideas evolved, while some remained mostly unchanged from first days they were pitched. By the end of the event, the students understood the importance of solving the right problem. The fact that Jonny was being mean and asking horrible questions seemed cruel at the time but it was worth it when the judges asked the exact same questions.

If you are a student and there is a 3DS near you, I highly recommend attending an event to learn how to solve the right problem. It’s what we do for our clients at pebble {code}, and it’s the kind of skill we look for when we hire at pebble {code}.

I’ll leave you with this:
