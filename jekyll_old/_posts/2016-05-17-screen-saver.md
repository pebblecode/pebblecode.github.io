We’ve had TVs mounted on the wall in the pebble office as far back as I can remember. In meeting rooms, these screens have a clear and definite purpose - we can hook up our laptops via HDMI cables to share presentations, and we have Chrome boxes attached for video Hangouts.

We also have a number of other screens in the main office areas, but for a long time they have been dark. We’ve just not had a reliable, accessible way of displaying anything on them, or to be honest, any bright ideas on what to display.

Recently, this has changed. When the Raspberry Pi Zero (a $5 computer) was launched, we bought quite a few of them - not with any particular usage in mind, but we knew we’d use them in our hack days, and find other uses for this tiny, cheap piece of hardware.

We’ve also discovered a couple of neat services, that combined with the Pi Zero provide a great way for us to use our office screens to announce the cool things happening in the office, and to share general information in a quick and easy way.

Here’s our setup:

[Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) running [Pi Signage](http://pisignage.com) - this lightweight Pi image and web service allows us to create and manage playlists - using images, weblinks and videos - and pipe them to the TVs over the internet. We have a playlist showcasing recent outputs from the Creative team, our [‘Working From Home’](http://pebblecode.com/blog/november-wfh-slack/) Dashboard, showing who’s WFH and who’s WFO; and lastly [Propsboard](http://propsboard.com).

Propsboard hooks into our Slack channels, enabling anyone to give ‘Props’ to slack messages worthy of praise or sharing.

All in all, it’s a great, cheap way to turn screens into useful digital signs, that the whole team can interact with and use to share what’s going on across the office.
