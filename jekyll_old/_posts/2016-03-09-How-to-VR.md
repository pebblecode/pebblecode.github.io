## First of all, let me just say that building VR games is easy. 

*No, seriously. If I, someone with absolutely no experience of developing games—let alone 3d shapes, can learn it in a matter of hours—anyone who's interested CAN and everyone who is interested SHOULD. A year ago, I had a problem to solve and virtual reality was my means to achieve a solution. I am now a forever changed woman who feels compelled to further dispel the misconception that comes with approaching VR development--Harriet Tubman style. If you are fascinated by VR but feel like it would be too complicated to do yourself, you are disillusioned and this is written for you. By the end, you will understand why I think as many people possible should try it and how to get started quickly and affordably in just four steps!*

*Ready?*

## Virtual Reality--More than just games
VR is a has become a gamechanger tech invention that has finally found its way to the masses after many failed attempts over the last 20 or so years. The technological advancements of the last 15 years have given VR technology the legs to stand on--and to our surprise, wings to fly. [Literally][1].

VR tricks our minds out into believing that what we are seeing is reality. It brings with it a whole new layer to the human experience and the way we interact with physical environments, technology, and people. Unforeseen, however, were the unintended impacts that research has discovered that VR has on our cognitive thinking. It has the power to shape our behavior, facilitate learning, and elicit profound emotions.

## What does virtual reality's impact mean? 

Virtual Reality gives us the means to design -- not just experiences, but also influence the way we think, change our habits, affect our perception in the real world and so much more. VR is no longer just a recreational tool. Research consistently shows promise for so much untapped potential. As a result, industries unrelated to gaming are beginning to explore its possibilities for other uses --creating alternate realities that can influence habits--consciously and unconsciously. 

VR has also been relied on for the last decade as an effective and resourceful means for military training simulation in the US.

Healthcare industries in its in new wave of digital transformation efforts have already begun to experiment with VR as an innovative solution to improve clinical care and even dynamically change the experience of patients during their [hospital stay][2].

Social Scientists fields have successfully found a way to use VR to [reduce prejudice][3].

Even world leaders are beginning to adopt VR as an [empathy-development tool][4] that would make for more effective policy-making that affect at risk groups of people in different parts of the world. 

>The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed.

*- William Gibson*


As promising as VR is for the world and its potential to influence and solve man-made problems, the numbers of VR game developers isn’t growing at the same rapid pace of its global popularity. Unlike the coding scene of the tech industry, game development--let alone for VR, isn’t exactly promoting itself outside their market like other related industries. 

As a result, we think of virtual reality game development as something reserved for a group of serious expert/nerd developers on a completely different level from coding and designing. 

## Why should you learn?

>The problem the ecosystem faces is that the consumers who are most interested in virtual reality do not have the spending power necessary to support high-end devices.
>Llamas says PC and console virtual reality’s [high barrier to entry] will cause three out of four early adopters to opt for more affordable mobile devices.

*- [Fortune, 2016][15]*

With Oculus Rift being released at the whopping price of $599, and now Vive being marked at $900+, it’s clear that the industry still aims to engage only a niche community of serious long-time gamers. The tools and services still only have been made accessible, *whether intentional or not*, to exclude a large array of demographics.  As well as the high price point, releasing the Oculus DK2 in limited amounts, and discontinuing its Mac OS X platform support have also limited the access to the technology to [younger and more liberal segments][16] of the population.

*But will we allow it?!!!*

Now more than ever, it is imperative for as many diverse people from all walks of life to jump into the VR scene. You don't have to be a game expert--just be someone with a problem you want to solve. You don't have to be a VR development enthusiast--just someone who appreciates the impacts of it. And best of all, you don't have to have money--you just have to be resourceful and know how to use the internet for help. 

Anyone with a computer can take advantage of all the free online resources that give the ability to develop VR games and realities. When this happens, the diversity of people’s experiences, perceptions, and passions will allow VR to develop more universally. This in turn will allow us to solve problems and address challenges in potentially overlooked/neglected communities, that in the long-term, affects us all. 

## My experience learning to develop a virtual reality game

>"...and yet the true creator is necessity, who is the mother of invention."

*- Plato*

I was very fortunate when undertaking my Master’s in Interaction Design last year that my program got a hold of an Oculus DK2. However, it was just collecting dust in the corner because everybody--including the staff (one of them holding a Ph.D in Game Design) were too intimidated to try it out. 

But lo and behold, the power of will--when you are on the verge of a solution to combat a neverending source of frustration and the only thing in your way is a lack of game development skills and money. Ha!

You see, I had a particular problem I wanted to solve that had stemmed from a lot of my frustrations as a women of color being subjected to microaggressions on a regular basis in the tech field. 

*A [microaggression][6] is defined as unintentional insults communicated to marginalized groups of people based on a everyday basis due to the nature of social structures and normalized perceptions in society. A common struggle for all kinds of minorities in the contemporary world, and often likened to ‘death by a thousand paper cuts’.*

During my research, I discovered the term ‘unconscious bias’. This is the phenomenon of well-meaning people holding underlying beliefs that skew judgements and perceptions. My research allowed me to understand the problem on a deeper level that guided me to start probing more effective solutions beyond the surface level.  The most intriguing discovery to me was the topic of empathy. Empathy has risen to be a popular term amidst the discussions of bias, inclusion, and diversity that have been stirred in Silicon Valley the last couple of years--and it is now spreading across industries like a crazy wildfire. 

While digging for more information on its correlation to bias, I discovered an amazing [TED Talk by Chris Milk][9] on his discovery of the link between empathy and virtual reality: 

![Chris Milk: Virtual Reality and Empathy TED Talk](/img/posts/2016-03-09-VR/chrismilk.png)

Thanks to resources on the internet -- Youtube, Unity 3D Tutorials, and community forums, I was able to construct a virtual reality game that incorporated proven ‘counter-bias’ methods. Ultimately, I was able to incorporate empathy-building methods into a game and successfully create a [working prototype][17] over the course of 4 months.  It was my attempt to introduce an innovative workplace solution that would help to improve diversity & inclusion efforts of tech companies in a comfortable and fun way. 

>...having a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to driving the creation and execution of new products, services, and business processes.”

*- [Forbes Insight, 2011][19]*


This experience has led me to wonder what other problems that could be solved--most especially on the emotional level with virtual reality? It’s also opened my eyes to the need for this to get into the hands of as many diverse people as possible if we are to solve problems on a more diverse scale.

>"Decades of research by organizational scientists, psychologists, sociologists, economists and demographers show that socially diverse groups (that is, those with a diversity of race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation) are more innovative than homogeneous groups.

*- [Scientific American, 2014][18]()

The tech industry is in the business of solving problems and innovation for the world. One of the smartest things we can do with a tool of unlimited potential for a global population is experiment with diverse input of people at maximum scale---and it’s not going to happen quickly enough when left in the hands of a few privy people. 


## Good News! You can learn to build for VR in less than an hour!

Knowing the power of virtual reality and its potential to be a problem-solver for so many industries and facets of life, it’s time that the masses are invited in to join in on the action. If you have a smartphone, $20 and a pc/laptop--you’re in! 

Google is championing the power of the people with Google Cardboard as an amazingly affordable alternative. Along with free game engines (and their associated development tools) like Unity 3D that make it _way_ too easy to set up and build a VR environment in minutes. I’d say it is comparable to drawing something up on Adobe Illustrator, pressing a button, putting on your goggles and BOOM. You are an official VR developer. 

If you have a passion for creating things and solving problems, have a little spare time on your hands, and have no money...I assure you this will be a fun, learning experience.
