## Don’t Just Buy Fish.

In 2016, Business Owners are very aware that an increasingly digital world brings with it a smorgasbord of enticing opportunities and an equal number of worrying threats.

It’s no longer provocative to talk about ‘disruption’ - even the most traditional of thinkers accept that every product or service we encounter has been, or will be, threatened by a new, innovative, digital businesses. Even businesses that were the original ‘disruptors’ are now facing new challenges from the latest hipster-shoreditch-silicon-valley upstarts.

It’s not about to slow down either - we’re in an age where teenagers are [building Redstone CPUs in Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQqWorbrAaY); Youtube stars are [earning more than Hollywood stars](http://www.polygon.com/2015/10/9/9490109/minecraft-streamer-buys-4-5m-hollywood-home-notch-captain-sparklez), and toddlers understand how to surf [YouTube on their iPads](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3149025/The-iPad-really-child-s-play-half-toddlers-use-Apple-s-tablet-just-ONE-researchers-say.html).

Even more significantly, kids can code before they finish school. Creating a website or simple mobile application; hooking up a Raspberry Pi to sensors - these are increasingly core competencies of today’s school kids, where 10 years ago this sort of digital understanding was still the domain of niche tech enthusiasts.

As this digitally-aware, code-capable generation reaches work age, they will simultaneously increase the demand for innovative product, and be the driving force behind creating it.

Smart Businesses are aware of the exponentially advancing world we live in, and accept that there is an increasing need to evolve, or die. That’s often where our conversations begin - organisations seek our expertise to help them innovate and change their product.

Thankfully, the majority of people we speak to realise that this means a great deal more than ‘jazzing up the website’ or giving their app a ‘lick of paint’. Even so, you’d be surprised by how often we’re asked by prospective clients to do exactly that.

## Give a Man A Fish

There are any number of software houses out there that hire the brightest young minds and produce excellent software. We’re not unique in that respect. We do Design Thinking; we operate with Agility (and we know that means more than ‘knowing how to do Scrum’) and our output is to a consistently high standard. We Deliver Great Software.

But then, so do lots of companies. Ultimately, how does that alone help our clients? It gives them a short term advantage. It helps them meet that goal of innovation...  once.

Give a man a Fish and he’ll feed his family for a day.


## But teach him how to fish…

We teach our clients how to fish (not literally - though if that’s your bag, sure let’s get on a boat).

Yes, there’s always delivery involved: our team will create great product on behalf of our clients, but our core belief is that the real power lies in helping organisations to deliver that excellence from within. We lend our culture - embedding Kaizen, Agile and Lean; we demonstrate and teach the tools - Design Thinking and User-Centric research; We ‘show the thing’ through rapid prototyping and espousing the virtue of Minimum Viable Product.

Ultimately, we simultaneously enable our clients to use pebble as a vehicle to deliver digital transformation, and give them the key elements that drive that process from within - right up to hiring their development team and embedding the culture to drive success.

We teach our clients not only how to fish, but we give them the rod, bait, boat and nets to haul in the big catch time after time.
