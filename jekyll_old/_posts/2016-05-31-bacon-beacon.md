## A better way to find bacon

Here at pebble we love getting to share our way of working with new people, so on Thursday 26th May, we invited a team from [PA Consulting](http://www.paconsulting.com/) to spend a day hacking in our offices.

The theme was retail and consumer goods. After a bite to eat, we started discussing ideas and forming teams. Having seen a presentation by the [Wayfindr team](https://www.wayfindr.net/ ), I was keen to explore the potential of iBeacon technology, and quickly narrowed my area of interest to in-store navigation. Not long later, the concept of Bacon Beacon was born.

Before we get on to that though, let me tell you about a young man named Frank.

It was 10:45am. Frank woke up, groggy from last nights' great party. He heard a buzzing beside him and saw his phone glowing with a message from his mum:

*“Good morning! Be with you in 15 minutes, can’t wait to see your new flat!”*.

His body jolted into action as he swiftly realised he was completely unprepared for the brunch he was meant to host for his parents. The fridge was empty. His housemate mentioned a Tesco Superstore round the corner, but, having never been, he knew he would never find all the ingredients in time. So many aisles to search. So many miles of walking! If only there was some way to pinpoint the locations of the products he wanted to buy. 

Alas, Frank lived in a world without Bacon Beacon. This meant he had to search the whole store for some bacon. While he was endlessly wandering, his parents turned up at his flat, saw he wasn’t in, and departed in fury. They disowned Frank shortly after. He fell into a deep downward spiral, lost his job, travelled to Thailand to find himself, met a spiritual guru, and was never heard of again.

Meanwhile, back in London, Rob Armes, Ian Black, Conrad Crates and Dave Hillier were working hard. 

#### Our Goal
To navigate to a product in a store

#### Our Process
We split the team into two strands. The development team got to work on reading locations from iBeacons, while the design team worked on the user experience.

The development team explored a range of possible options before settling on a native android app. This would allow access to the bluetooth and compass capabilities of the phone. The process of pinpointing the nearest beacon didn't run as smoothly as planned. Thankfully, with perseverance, by the end of the day they were able to get the device to point at different beacons. Unfortunately, time ran out before any navigational guidance could be integrated.

Meanwhile the design team produced a set of wireframes, created an animation to visualise the experience of the app, and put together a marketing site.

#### The Outcome
Although we couldn’t use the app to navigate, it was a great experience for the team. We met new people, with different skillsets, and tried out some new tech too.

While we may have lost the hack day, we live in hope that with a bit more work, our idea could stop the world losing more people like Frank.
