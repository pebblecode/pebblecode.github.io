A winemaker must feed and water his vines regularly, check their leaves for health, and know how to balance nutrients, sunlight and water.

What would happen if he were to ignore his field for 364 days of the year? His grapes may well wither and die, or be blighted by insects or disease. He would not be aware of any problems until it was too late to take any corrective action.

It’s unlikely that a winemaker would adopt such a careless approach to the very things that he relies on to make his product, and provide him with an income. So why is it that so many businesses and managers feel that the ‘annual review’ is an appropriate way of developing and growing the people in their business?

At pebble {code} our product is mostly intangible - we help organisations innovate and realise value through embracing digital transformation. As the winemaker relies upon his vines to make wine, we depend entirely on our people to provide our product.

The people that make up pebble {code} are our most important asset, so our organisation must support, develop and reward the individuals that make us what we are.

As an organisation, we wax lyrical on the benefits of continuous improvement; build/measure/learn; failing fast and often. Yet, until recently, we followed the traditional, well trodden path of annual assessments and pay reviews. It was ineffective, un-inspirational and felt out of sync with our core values.
We knew this had to change, so we applied some of the tools we use with our clients to try and solve this problem.

## Improvement Kata

Toyota are famous for applying the Improvement Kata to their business. The essence of the Improvement Kata is a four part model:

* Determine a vision or direction
* Grasp the current condition.
* Define the next target condition.
* Move toward that target condition iteratively, which uncovers obstacles that need to be worked on.

We began by defining what we considered ‘The Definition of Awesome’. What does success look like?

* Continuous improvements - our people need regular feedback to know that they’re on the right path. Failing leads to learning -  as long as the failure is identified and understood.
* A reduced ‘bus factor’. Our hierarchy is relatively flat - we don’t have lots of ‘middle managers’ - which leads to the founders often being the go-to people for appraisals. We need to reduce the time pressure on them, and enable the process to work almost independently of them.
* More and better quality feedback. It’s hard, even in a small company, for a manager to have a detailed insight into the achievements, wins and losses of 20+ people. At best, they have an ‘overall’ idea, which is perhaps not representative of an individual’s true strength and value. We need to improve the information we have by querying more sources.

With ‘Awesome’ now defined, we examined our current conditions and broke down the problem into clear, definable issues that we needed to tackle:

* We had no clearly defined or well documented careers paths;
* Annual reviews were the sole responsibility of the leadership team, and they are often busy.
* When they happened, reviews were often unproductive, as the line managers didn’t always have detailed insight into an individual's performance;
* We had no common framework against which to measure or to provide feedback

Now, we knew where we were going. We’d identified the issues, and could now begin to take steps to get to a result.

## Straw Man

*Build it up, knock it down*

There are no secrets at pebble. We are open and honest with the team about pretty much every aspect of the business - from financial performance & cash in the bank, to the health or otherwise of the sales pipeline. Sharing our successes breeds confidence. Sharing the need to improve encourages participation and an engaged team contributes to solving a problem.

Rarely is that more true when career paths and remuneration are the topic of discussion. We set up some open sessions to gather input and ideas on how to solve the problems we identified. The meeting room was full of people keen to share their ideas - discussion was free-flowing and contributions were positive.

There is however a practical limit to the number of ideas and contributions we could collate and incorporate. Amongst a group of 10 people there could easily be 100 different ideas. A major learning from these initial session was that we needed to create a straw man - a prototype to guide the discussions, to be kicked around, pulled apart and improved upon.

## Build, Measure Learn

## Build

A smaller group began to build a model we called the ‘Pebble People Profile’ - a set of skills, behaviours and responsibilities that we valued in the the business, and that represent key attributes for each level of career progression. We ranked and ordered these attributes, and linked them to show pathways of development and  improvement.

We looked at market rates for roles, and built a model to map an individual’s route through the profile to a monetary value - factoring in location and length of service.

We now had a personal development framework that seemed to support our designers and developers, and was aligned with the objectives or the organisation.

Bi-annual and annual reviews were out the window. We wrote a manifesto to guide and empower individuals to take control of their own development. No more reliance on the leadership team - only a reliance on the individual.

We encouraged our team to seek feedback as often as they could - at least every few sprints, or at significant milestones in projects; they should speak to their peers and our clients; they should evaluate themselves and identify their own successes and failures. They should offer the same feedback to their peers and use the principles of Kaizen to highlight the good and identify improvements.

The sentence that seemed to exemplify our goals was simple:

*It’s all about self-directed learning with feedback from your peers.*

The underlying message was that you were the architect of your own career progression. If you felt it was time to move up the ladder, it was within your power to gather feedback, measure yourself, and bring it to the team.

## Measure

We tested the process with a few open minded individuals. Immediately, we were able to make improvements from their feedback - shifting certain attributes up or down between levels; adjusting our criteria and the language to be more relevant.

We also ran the numbers - we made some broad brush assumptions to see what the financial effect of implementing this plan would have on our wage bill. We needed to be sure that the business could support the salary changes that might result from launching our new way of thinking.

## Learn

We analysed our problem; we defined what success looked like; we built a prototype and tested it. Now to launch it onto the wider pebble community.

Is that job done? Not quite. We see our People Process as an evolving, improving thing. We intend to iterate as we use it. Borrowing from McKinsey, we believe everyone within pebble  is intelligent and has valuable insights to offer - we remind our team that they have an obligation to dissent. If they think something is wrong, then they need to contribute to fixing or improving it. This is the ‘build-measure-learn’ loop at the core of pebble’s culture..

Right now, we believe we have made a great start on changing our progression culture, and are excited to see the improvements our team can make to it.

## Build It!

Having launched our new process, a team of pebble developers and UX/UI specialists spent a week building a web app to support our new way of thinking. A working beta was delivered in just a week, and we began using it for reviews immediately. We’re continually iterating on the process and adding features to the application - we’ll share more updates here as we release.

We’re happy to share our People Profile, Manifesto and Personal Development application and hope that what we’ve learnt so far may be useful to other organisations - please feel free to distribute, discuss and feedback. If you’d like a tour of the product, drop me an [email](mailto:paul@pebblecode.com) and we’ll be happy to give you a demo.

If you’re interested to learn more about the methodologies and processes that we use here at pebble {code} we’d love to tell you more. [Get in touch](mailto:hello@pebblecode.com).
