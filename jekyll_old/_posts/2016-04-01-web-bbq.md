At Google's [Progressive Web Apps event in London](http://lanyrd.com/2016/progressive-web-apps-london/) last month, the 
Chrome team shared just how many [exciting new possibilities are on the horizon](https://www.chromestatus.com/features) 
for web developers. But one of the new APIs stood out beyond all others: *Web BBQ*.

Web BBQ was unveiled by Googler and apparent flame-grilled food fan [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake). 
It offers the tantalising promise of having a common way to communicate with outdoor barbecues, via a built-in Web API. 
The aim is to democratise the control of barbecues, by standardising how your browser talks to them.

Imagine arriving at a friend's barbecue party and the sausages are sizzling away. Suddenly your host is called away, 
just when the bacon is about to burn! Thankfully, with your mobile phone, you can turn down the heat yourself, without 
waiting to download a native app first. Your host's bacon has just been saved, thanks to Web BBQ!

The Web BBQ specification is currently a collaboration between the Chrome, Firefox and Edge teams. Unfortunately Safari 
support may be unlikely anytime soon; Apple are rumoured to be planning their own premium, integrated solution: 
*Apple BBQ*.

Although a number of other browser features discussed at the event sound promising too (for example [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API),
[Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/) and [Geofencing](http://www.plotprojects.com/geofencing-in-webapps/)), 
Web BBQ is clearly the most important, since it's the only one that can be used to cook perfectly-grilled sausages.

If you're as excited about Web BBQ as we are, [send us a tweet](https://twitter.com/pebblecode). We promise to invite 
you over for a celebratory barbecue, just as soon as the feature lands!
