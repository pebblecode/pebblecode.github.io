We’ve all read recent hype about machine learning and the artificial intelligence revolution, but what does it actually 
mean for your business?

While prominent thinkers have been issuing [stark warnings](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat) 
about how profound - and potentially catastrophic - artificial intelligence could be, [critics point out](http://www.balderton.com/news/why-we-wont-build-sentient-ai-in-our-lifetime) 
that the field of AI has been bubbling around for decades and computers are still nowhere near human-level intelligence. 
Some say [progress is exponential](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html); others 
say [it’s linear](http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm).

Whatever the future holds, the truth is that [machine learning](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/machine-learning) 
is already making a big impact on business. Although we’re still a way off from “general” artificial intelligence, there 
are many impressive examples of “narrow” intelligence, i.e. computers learning how to solve specific kinds of problems. 
Smart recommendation engines, number plate recognition, spam filters and automatic translation are just a few of many 
examples. 

It certainly seems as though progress is becoming more rapid now. Due to [the recent breakthroughs of cheap parallel 
computation, the rise of "Big Data", and better algorithms like "Deep Learning"](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence/), 
computers are becoming able to perform more and more complex tasks, with less and less specific up-front guidance.

Deep Learning recently hit the news by enabling computers to [play Atari games like a pro](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/google-ai-plays-atari-like-pros/) 
and to beat a grandmaster at Go, but the fun facade of game-playing should not detract from its serious business 
potential. Machine learning now helps to [power Google Search](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2015/11/12/what-is-google-rankbrain-and-why-does-it-matter/#2184f78c301a) 
and [Facebook’s News Feed](http://time.com/3950525/facebook-news-feed-algorithm/). Other companies investing heavily in 
its potential include Amazon, Twitter, Uber and IBM. Companies like [Quora are sharing details of how they’re applying Machine Learning in real life](http://www.slideshare.net/xamat/10-more-lessons-learned-from-building-machine-learning-systems/6-ML_Applications_Quora_Answer_ranking). 
According to the FT, the investor rush to artificial intelligence [is “the real deal”](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/019b3702-92a2-11e4-a1fd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3zsarD56E).

So how can you take advantage of machine learning to transform your own business? Here are three key tips:

## 1. Keep humans at the centre

As usual, we recommend starting from the perspective of your users. [User-centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) 
still applies; first and foremost, machine learning needs to work for us humans!

Keeping “humans in the loop” can have great benefits for efficiency and accuracy too:


> “Human-in-the-loop” computing“ [is] a best practice in nearly every successful deployment of machine learning... 
> First, a machine learning model takes a first pass on the data... If the confidence score is below a certain value, 
> it sends the data to a human annotator to make a judgment. 
> That judgment is used both for the business process and is fed back into the machine learning algorithm to 
> make it smarter.”

  — From: *[Why human-in-the-loop computing is the future of machine learning](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3004013/robotics/why-human-in-the-loop-computing-is-the-future-of-machine-learning.html)*

## 2. Generate ideas

Could smarter systems help to improve the experience of your products? Could machine learning enable better 
recommendations? Faster purchases? Maybe even new products?

How about your staff? Could smarter systems make your internal business processes more efficient? What takes up people’s 
time? What could take less time?

If you’re still short on ideas, a workshop will soon generate plenty!

## 3. Build, measure and learn

We believe the best way to explore new technologies is to [hack around](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/01/29/modern_technology_and_the_history_of_the_word_hack.html) 
with them. Build prototypes and test them out. [Make lots of small bets](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Bets-Breakthrough-Emerge-Discoveries/dp/1439170436), 
test them with users, measure the results and double down on the most promising.

You probably don’t need to actually develop a machine learning service yourself, to learn whether or not it could be 
valuable for your users and your business. There are a growing a number of [cloud services](http://www.zdnet.com/article/watch-out-watson-here-comes-aws-machine-learning/) 
and [open source frameworks](http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/14/deep-learning-frameworks/) available. Even a 
[paper prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping) of a machine learning powered product may help you 
to learn valuable information about it.

While the [Second Machine Age](http://pebblecode.com/blog/book-review-the-second-machine-age/) won’t happen overnight, 
it’s a good bet that machine learning will have a serious impact on many businesses over the next few years. If you get 
the strategy right now, you could put your business in the best position to catch the wave.
