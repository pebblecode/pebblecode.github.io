We’re passionate about crafting outstanding software. We put top notch people into small, dynamic teams, give them the best tools and encourage maximum collaboration in our stimulating and spacious work environment, and we find that’s how to make big things happen.

We are signatories to the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto and believe in contributing to, not just consuming [open source projects](https://github.com/pebblecode "our Github!"){:target="_blank"}. We are strong advocates for the Agile Development methodology and believe passionately in Human-Centred Design and Test Driven Development. Our staff are polyglots with expertise in Microsoft and Open Source technologies, choosing application stacks based on the technical challenges presented to us.
