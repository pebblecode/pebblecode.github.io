    - Health care provision has historically been designed around moving patients through a system as efficiently as possible.
    - In our primary research with cancer patients we discovered that this top-down approach is not working efficiently for the very people it is meant to serve.
    - list-title: "We discovered:"
    - list:
       - "<span>Patients</span> regularly carry around huge folders of notes to manage a complex process."
       - "Patients want greater ownership and transparency over their condition."
       - "Patients are highly intelligent about their condition and want raw data over dumbed down summaries."
       - "Little or no provision is made for the emotional side for life-changing conditions like cancer."
    - We believe there are numerous opportunities to realise cost-savings, improve patient experience and life expectancies by considering health care as a network around individuals rather than asking a patient to pass through unconnected silos.

   paragraphs:
    - In our interactions with the Health sector we have noticed that Research Scientists are increasingly using Computer Science to accelerate processes and discovery and to reduce costs.
    - list-title: "We have observed:"
    - list:
       - "Research Scientists are developing programming skills."
       - "Organisations are buying misplaced off-the-shelf data products."
       - "Big Data is being widely espoused but is poorly understood."
       - "An emerging discipline of data visualisation."
    - We believe that by formalising a symbiotic relationship between the two disciplines of Research Science and Computer Science organisations can realise cost-savings, shorten discovery cycles and deliver a Smart Research capability.
    - Furthermore for publicly funded organisations and charities we advocate an Open Data Policy where research data is made available to third-parties by default.
    - We believe that unlocking new meaning from data through openness and collaboration has the potential to accelerate discovery and understanding.

   paragraphs:
    - To date Government Institutions, Charities and Pharmaceuticals have conceived of digital innovation from a top-down perspective. Simply put large, monolithic organisations struggle to innovate at the speed of the open market. Top-down innovation is also extremely risky, often resulting in high profile failures like the NHS Patient Record system.
    - We believe by starting small and involving users early and often in the process that innovation projects stand a better chance of success. Gradually, we believe large organisations can learn to innovate like the open market.
