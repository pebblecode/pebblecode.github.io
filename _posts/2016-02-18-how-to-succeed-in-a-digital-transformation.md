If your company was established before the digital revolution - or hasn’t yet embraced it fully - transforming into a digital first company can be hugely daunting. We have all heard tales of industry-leading companies failing to make the transition and [being disrupted](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130227142546-2293140-digital-darwinism-what-killed-borders-blockbuster-and-polaroid-and-how-not-to-end-up-like-them) by young digital upstarts. However, it most definitely is possible for companies to make this journey successfully - and here at [pebble {code}](http://pebblecode.com) we have helped many to do so.

So what are the keys to success? We’ve distilled them down into a set of best practices. Follow these principles and you should be on the right track towards digital dominance!

The **right approach** is to secure commitment from the top of the company down. In-source your product management and grow your own in-house software development capabilities over time.

Build the **right thing** by embracing user-centred design and [developing minimum viable products](http://theleanstartup.com/principles#develop_mvp) to learn from. You don’t have to develop everything yourself; source building blocks from suppliers, open source, or off-the-shelf.

Then develop the **thing right**. Empower your teams with the capabilities they need for success. Use the best software development practices from [lean startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) and [Agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/). Finally, [don’t view what you’re building as projects](http://evan.bottch.com/2010/08/29/projects-are-evil-and-must-be-destroyed/) that can be wrapped up in a few weeks or months - they’re products and they will only blossom with continued love and attention.

We hope these best practices will help to stand you in good stead. If you would like a hand with your own digital transformation, from digital product innovation to sprinkling a bit of startup over your enterprise, [get in touch](http://pebblecode.com/contact/)!
