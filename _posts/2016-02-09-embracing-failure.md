When things go wrong for someone I know, I can't help but be reminded of a quote from Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins.

![Quote 1](/img/blog/embracing-failure/blog-illustrations-02.png)
 
Why do many people admire Batman? Is it that he just a natural born badass? Maybe. Do we adore him because of his incredible wealth? Hopefully not. Perhaps it's his ability to build a successful plan to solve every problem threatening Gotham? Seems feasible. Batman’s journey is never a perfect, happy one. He often stumbles along the way, but he learns from his mistakes, and motivates himself to try again. And again. And again. He never admits defeat in the eyes of failure.
 
Here at pebble {code} we often speak of _"embracing failure"_ or _"failing fast"_. To the uninitiated this might seem like an unusual way of thinking - I certainly don't remember teachers at school reminding me to get bad grades. My parents never encouraged me to perform poorly. I’m pretty sure my employers don't want me stumbling about in the dark, eyes closed to troubles ahead, as if any cock-up is fantastic.  So what does embracing failure really mean?
 
To me it means three things. To challenge myself, to demand feedback, and to iterate based on that feedback. To do these three things involves intelligently embracing failure, in one form or another.

## Challenge yourself

I've been a climber on and off for the last 10 years, and with new walls popping up all over the city, I often get a chance to join a friend or colleague for their first time on the wall. Naturally they have a resistance to climb anything out of their comfort zone, at the risk of falling off. It can take a while to get used to hanging from your fingertips, meters off the ground. I give them the same piece of advice that I have to remind myself of when I'm feeling lazy:

Some view failure as the loss of control, and this is certainly true when you come flying off a climb into the faces of the spectators below. When this happens you have to adjust the way you approach the problem, or how you handle the aftermath of the event. Shifting your weight this way or that, pinching a hold differently, resting longer or pulling harder. It doesn't always work, but more often than not you manage to progress a little further the next time.
 
The same applies at work. You have to take on new challenges and learn new things all the time, some of which might make you feel a little out of control. It’s how you react to these events that matters.
Iterate on your ideas
 
As a designer, when I work on a problem, I do my best not to just stride straight along a single path to a solution. It might be that by picking one route, I could end on an alright outcome, but without testing other ideas, I have no way to identify its benefits over any other. By trying multiple routes, I can disregard some as failures, and then continue to refine the successes. By repeating this process continually, I am more likely to end up with a well designed result.

That's not to say that creating endless failures is useful. I could spend an unlimited amount of time coming up with wrong solutions, but really that would be nothing more than poor time management. Through experience, you learn where to draw the line (Or stop drawing it).
Get Feedback
 
Honest feedback can be tricky, especially if it comes across as negative. We are emotional creatures, and form attachments to our work such that a criticism of it can feel like a criticism of ourselves.
 
I will never forget when, one social evening, a group of my closest friends played a round of _"Eight, hate a mate"_. How this works is, if you pick an 8 from a pack of cards, you tell each person in the room one thing you hate about them. No holds barred. The line delivered to me was painful! It highlighted how completely blind I was to how others could perceive my actions. Hearing that critique was like an admission of my failure as a good friend. Admission of failure makes us feel vulnerable. They can also be liberating.
 
We vowed never to play that game again, but I know it was one of the best pieces of advice I have ever been given. While I'm sure I still make the same mistakes they called me up on, I've certainly tried to improve upon it.
 
I actually think our friendship is better because of their moment of honesty.
 
Here at pebble, we try to advocate the idea of releasing software as early as possible, and putting it out for feedback so we can rapidly inspect and adapt our product to suit its users. It doesn't matter how much we love a piece of design if the intended customer finds it unusable. A working prototyping might have a higher initial cost, but could save much more in the long run. In the presence of high levels of uncertainty, it can often be less expensive to start working on a product, learn whether we made a good decision, and if not, stop before more money is spent.
 
You can't always get things right the first time, and mistakes can be made by anyone, but not all mistakes are equal. In fact, it isn't really these failures we seek at all, but the success that (hopefully) follow them.
 
The key to embracing failure is to use your failures to guide intelligent decisions. Using an iterative approach of experimentation and prototyping, you can turn these inevitable and unforeseen events from something negative to something beneficial.
 
Just like Batman.
