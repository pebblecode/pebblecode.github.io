##Practical Approaches to Innovation

It takes anywhere from 7 seconds all the way down to a millisecond for someone to form an opinion - about a person, a product, about anything. And every minute, consumers are inundated with ads, links, sights, and sounds. Life moves fast. 

If you want your product or service to stand out, you need to change the way you reach your audience. 

Innovation has always been the only way to move forward; digital innovation is the way of the future. 

Innovation starts at the foundation. It is a way of thinking, a set of beliefs and practices that guides every decision. For all intents and purposes, innovation is a culture all its own. 

So how does one become “innovative?” 


Innovation does not magically seep from bubblegum pink walls and waft off standing desks as you may have thought. Innovation, instead, starts with people. 

It may seem daunting to think about adding more employees to your roster, or letting some old ones go. Yes, innovation is all about people, but we didn’t say it was all about new people: change the way your company does business internally and you can change the way you present yourself to current customers and potential clients. 

In a recent conversation with Kate Russell on [“Digital Leaders,”][1] Toby (Co-founder of pebble {code}) testified to the impact of an [Agile][2] workflow in any industry as a means to achieving innovation. The main tenets of of Agile reflect broader goals of innovation.  (You can watch Toby’s talk alongside Annette Sweeney and Richard Grove in full [here][3].)

Innovation is part of everyday life - we just don’t think of it that way. Every time you adjust a routine, you’re innovating; if one part just isn’t working, you go back to the drawing board and find something that solves the issue.

Innovation is not some large, abstract concept that requires complete overhauling changes. 

It’s scary to think about, but we’re here to help.
