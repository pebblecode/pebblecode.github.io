This is a mind-boggling sentence that I never thought I’d write: European Robins have a quantum computer in their eyes. That was just one little fact from an almost overwhelming deluge of fascinating and thought-provoking talks at the How to Change the World Conference.

Taking place in the Royal Institution lecture hall, the room that brought the world the elements Potassium and Argon, the audience were up close and personal with cutting edge science. A few themes emerged that cut across the talks.

##Sustainability
Humanity currently stands at 7 billion individuals, and we’re on course for 9 or 10 billion by the end of the century. We are by far the most successful large mammal. This success brings costs. By 2020 the carbon footprint of the world’s data centres will exceed that of the airline industry. We are way in the red for water use as well - unsustainable in large swathes of the world. Without serious measures being taken, we could be in line to repeating the disaster of the Aral Sea on a global scale. 

Water use is counter-intuitive - the amount that we use domestically is dwarfed by the magnitude of our indirect water use: If we stopped showering we would each save 50L/Day, yet if we stopped eating meat we would save 800L/Day. In fact in this country 75% of our water footprint is spent outside the UK.

Measures which are environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint often have an undesirable water footprint. Hydro-Electric power is an obvious example, but less obvious are fuels such as biodiesel which require so much water to produce that they cannot be the future. 

##Jobs
In line with the growing population, we need to find a way for people to make a living. Recent years have seen a hollowing out of middle income jobs. The disappearance of these jobs is routine-biased - in other words those jobs that have the most repetitive and routine tasks have been most at risk of being automated or outsourced. The conservation of jobs is skill-biased - the jobs that have been saved are those where computers complement, but do not replace skills. 

This hollowed out middle section of the income scale is now being joined by a hollowing out of the lower income jobs. In the UK, industrial jobs peaked in 1961. It now appears that other countries such as Mexico and Brazil have also gone past peak industrialisation. This means that we are now entering a post-industrial world where typically lower paid industrial jobs have disappeared, in favour of computerisation, automation, and robotics. 

The arrival of the tech boom of recent years has not been all good. It has been well publicised that WhatsApp, a company that was bought by Facebook for $22billion last year, only employs 55 engineers. This means that there are comparatively few highly skilled and highly paid employees in this sector, and job creation and economic growth is being decoupled. This pattern has been accompanied by a growing service sector that feed off this localised affluence. For example, there are now over 3,000 beach body coaches in the UK, when ten years ago there were none. 

The general rule when it comes to selecting a career that has a minimal risk of being automated is to focus on three factors:

* Creativity: Making products or services, or other intellectual capital that didn’t previously exist.
* Social Intelligence: Jobs that require a high degree of people/soft skills.
* Perception and Manipulation: Jobs that require fine manual work that cannot be replicated by machines.

##Aging
Across the world people are living longer. In developed countries people no longer die across the age range; most people are living much longer. In the UK, the life expectancy of a baby girl born in the UK in 2007 is now 103. We can expect 1.4 million centenarians by the year 2100. 

There is no reason to believe that the maximum age of humans is limited to the current record of 122. The question becomes whether quality of life can be maintained that long - the main threats being health and loneliness. 

##Proscribing or Prescribing
Psychedelic drugs have been illegal in the UK since 1967. This has made research into their effects either hard or impossible. Recent developments have seen interesting research findings concerning clinical efficacy in managing psychiatric issues. In particular, psychedelic drugs have a strong and long-lasting positive effect on anxiety and depression. They appear to cause a marked increase in extraversion and openness. Participants in these trials report an enduring spiritual and mystical enlightenment. 

Participants in these experiments frequently rate their experience with psychedelic drugs among the top five most meaningful events in their lives. In other words, they are considered similar to births of children or weddings in terms of profundity. 

Given that depression is the most costly brain disease in Europe, it appears that the thinking may be beginning to shift towards treatment with psychedelic drugs.

##Quantum Computing
The possibilities of quantum computers have long been theorised: a calculating device that can use quantum superposition to be in all possible states at once would be orders of magnitudes more powerful than computers we currently possess. It appears that these sorts of devices may already exist in nature. The robin is just one organism that appears to take advantage of quantum effects: It was long thought that robins had a biological compass in their beaks. This ability has evolved in nature a number of times. However experiments show that robins are not confused by magnetic fields many times more powerful than that of the earth. They still manage to orient themselves along their migratory routes. It appears that instead of magnetism, a molecule in their retina uses quantum effects to compute the inclination of the sun in order to locate the robin on the planet - a kind of biological sextant. 

It seems that quantum effects may be much more widespread than merely robins. In fact, the standard chlorophyll molecule in every plant may use quantum effects to transmit energy. The efficiency of energy transfer within chlorophyll is astonishing. It is anywhere between 95 and 99 percent, which is distinctly abnormal for a biochemical process. Quantum effects could be an explanation for this efficiency. 

These natural natural quantum effects raise the possibility that they could be used to create a quantum computer, and research efforts are underway to make that reality.
