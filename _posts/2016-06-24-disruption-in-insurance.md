Disruption is coming, and if you don’t think your business can be disrupted, you’re probably going to be next. Digital services have come of age, and the magic that has transformed our personal lives (think WhatsApp, Instagram, Uber) is coming to more and more businesses around us. Premiums in the UK insurance market totalled £330 billion in 2014, making it the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world. It is only natural that sleek new services that are digital to their core will come after a slice of this enormous pie. 

## What is the digital in ‘digital disruption’?

There exists a great deal of confusion surrounding the question of what makes a business truly digital. In the past, businesses decided that digital was just another channel through which they dealt with their customers. They would say to themselves ‘well we had an app made’ and think nothing more of it. This was a mistake, and many complacent incumbents are now reeling from the consequences of more nimble competitors snatching business from them.

A truly digital company has a fully integrated information architecture that supports the entire business workflow. It is not merely the customer that experiences a slick and optimized experience, but everyone in the workflow. This means that the apps that administrate are as intuitive and efficient as the apps that sell. Spreadsheets as a tool for business operation are a thing of the past. 

Look at the applications that you possess to run your business. If the users have a bunch of post-it reminders stuck to the bottom of their screen, are copying and pasting data between two separate applications or have created homebrew macros in Excel to help with their work, then you are going to be disrupted. All those are symptoms of inefficiency and sources of operational risk.

## The peer-to-peer insurance model

The insurance industry should be looking to the betting industry to understand what is on its way. Platforms such as Betfair have now been connecting punters with those who wish to lay bets for years. Betfair assumes very little risk as it does not itself need to be underwritten, but takes a commission on all bets placed. The odds are more competitive than traditional bookmakers as the individual layers of bets compete amongst themselves. Betfair merely provides the platform which is immensely scalable. They have no betting shops, and employ far fewer staff than regular bookies. As a result the traditional bookies have suffered by losing a great deal of business to Betfair. 

This analogous industry has showed the way for several platforms that are now gaining ground. Guevara has introduced a collectivised insurance model for car insurance. By pooling drivers together, a large discount on the insurance premium is provided. This works by the pool effectively underwriting itself up to a certain level, and the remaining risk being passed to the insurer. This model takes advantage of the market efficiency afforded by technology to quickly generate pools of drivers who all need insurance. This peer-to-peer model is gaining ground: at least three p2p insurance services are launching in the US in 2016. 

## The power of personalisation and customisation

Traditional insurance has been limited by the flexibility of products that can be underwritten. Newer and more flexible models will allow brokers to customise their offerings to more closely meet the needs of their clients. This means that insurance can move to becoming more of a problem solver than a reimburser of lost value. Think of the insurers that can provide a replacement car while yours is fixed after an accident. This sort of value-added service can be more widely supported by flexible business models. Perhaps the insurer can provide a same-day replacement camera for the wedding photographer who has lost his; or maybe a reputation management service for a financial services company that has been accused of mismanagement. 

## What can be done about digital disruption


The first step to protect yourself against digital disruption is to become digital yourself. This process involves the realignment of the company mindset to being the owner and creator of a set of continually developing and improving set of digital tools that provide maximum value as well as a competitive advantage. New tools can be integrated into existing ones, and existing tools can be adapted to suit new and changing markets. 

The next step is to start creating - using the principles of lean startups to quickly trial multiple products. By using the principles of fail fast and agile development techniques, insurance companies can quickly uncover new markets. Those trials that show promise are pursued, and those that fail are quickly shelved with no harm done. 

Incorporating human-centered design principles into your innovation strategy, you can truly get under the skin of your clients and customers. What is it like to buy things from you? How do your communications land? Where are the hidden points of weakness where you lose repeat business? User research techniques such as contextual inquiry and human factors testing can rapidly and dramatically improve your product.
