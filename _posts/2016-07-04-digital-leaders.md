Our own Toby Hunt, Director and Co-founder of pebble {code}, along with Head of the Digital Academy at DWP Annette Sweeney and Richard Grove, Chief Digital Officer at CoSector, University of London, joined Kate Russell at “Digital Leaders” to talk all things agile. [“Digital Leaders”][1] is an organisation that holds over 100 events each year (from YouTube salons to conferences), where accomplished professionals across the UK share opinions and best practices. 

These three digital leaders embrace agile in their workplaces and agreed that the process hinges on collaboration, engagement, and customer involvement and satisfaction. “If everyone is on the same page constantly, it really makes for a better working environment and a better ability to deliver a better product,” said Hunt. 

The message of the event was that Agile isn’t just for software development; it’s all about collaborating, iterating and delivering a product everyone is proud of and can be used to transform any aspect of an organisation. 

If you’re thinking, “Could agile help my business?” you’re not alone. The top advice from these leaders was:

* You need to work towards a new, more collaborative workforce. 
	All anyone wants in their career, and life more generally, is to be trusted and respected, and be given the opportunity to grow. Make everyone valuable and work will improve.
* You need buy-in from senior leaders and middle management.
	Support from key decision makers shows the rest of the organisation that the process is trusted. But they’re not just going to blindly follow you. So...
* You need to show your company a tangible product. 	
		Get your employees and later your clients on board with agile with proof that this process was used to turn out a working product, and that it’s not just a “nice idea.”
