Every morning, a ticket inspector walks along the crowded carriage, and I reach into my wallet and pull out a small piece of paper (purchased a year ago, now faded and torn) that tells him I’ve paid for my journey.

Technology plays a part in almost every transaction and interaction that occurs today - transport is no exception - yet there remains some archaic practices that are well overdue for an update.

What are the innovations and changes in travel technology that will affect commuters and leisure travellers over the next few years?

##Smart ticketing
In London, TfL has led the smart ticketing charge with Oyster, Contactless Cards and Apple Pay. Other rail operators are following suit.

From plastic Smart Cards and NFC payments to digital ticketing using smartphones and wearable tech - we’re using smart devices to replace the paper ticket that we’ve relied on for the last 100 years.

Digital Ticketing provides an opportunity to not only replace paper, but enhance the experience through data. A ticket stored on a smart device can provide a more personalised experience: contextual information, such as account balance and renewal notifications. It can learn your travel habits, integrate with your digital assistant and provide pro-active service notifications.

##Automated refunds
Location-aware smart devices, coupled with iBeacons will allow you to automatically track the progress of your journey (we’ve prototyped exactly this concept). When your train is late, this data can be used to automatically credit you when a service is delayed. A recent [super complaint](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35134682) is likely to force this type of innovation sooner rather than later.

##Passenger Engagement
There are plenty of smartphone apps that enable passengers to search train times and find out about delays. Most rail operators have twitter-based agents to announce delays and advise passengers, but all too often the information available to passengers is lacking.

Often, the problem stems from lack of inbound information to these agents or apps; they don’t always know the finer details of a delay, and can’t predict what the knock on effects will be or how long the delay will last for. It’s also hard for customer services to prioritise and deal with the many thousands of enquiries that flood in when delays occur.

Intelligent systems using historic data and machine learning could provide succinct, customised information relevant to individuals and their travel plans. This information could be provided pro-actively, potentially using intelligent agents like Siri or Google Now, giving passengers information that is relevant to them quickly and efficiently, even suggesting alternative routes or plans.

##Carriage Monitoring
Most train carriages and buses already have CCTV for security and safety. These same cameras could be used to monitor and manage passenger density in carriages. Machine vision is an area of technology that is rapidly improving; software could be used to identify empty seats and crowded carriages, letting staff and passengers know where to go to ensure better distribution of passengers and a more pleasant journey for all.

##Data Everywhere
High speed Wifi connections on trains and platforms. Wifi is now ubiquitous across most of the London Underground network and many operators provide wifi in carriages. Elsewhere, the UK’s ever expanding 4G networks provide high speed data to mobile devices. With the advent of 5G networks in the not too distant future, we’ll all be hooked up to super-fast, low latency data connections, wherever we are.

##Digital Advertising
Large, colour digital screens in carriages, providing up to the minute train information alongside rich media adverts, will no doubt replace the existing paper posters. Cost is likely to be the main barrier to this at the moment, as it’s already technically feasible. However, low cost, low power CPUs are widely available to drive the screens, and LED panel technology is getting cheaper. Digital signage mostly needs commitment from the ad-selling media companies. Touch screens could enable customer interaction and further enhance engagement and the availability of information.

##Self-driving trains
No doubt there would be strikes, but we could see an end to staff on trains. The DLR and to a large extent, the London Underground, are great examples of self-driving train technology in action. The DLR is entirely automated, and Underground trains already drive themselves from station to station, with the driver operating the doors.

##More Competition from other transport Modes
With the advent of new automotive technologies, vehicular transport is set to change in a big way. Whether it’s companies like Uber, offering cheaper and more efficient (and potentially driverless) cross-city travel, to electric vehicles providing cheaper and cleaner transport modes, rail is going to face stiff competition. Train operators will need to ensure that their trains are more comfortable, cost effective and efficient for passengers.

Imagine a fleet of self driving electric cars, able to take a passenger door to door, quickly and cleanly, and then make themselves available for the next passenger.


Change in Transport Technology is accelerating - we’re excited to be working with rail operators such as National Express and c2c, and other organisations in the transport and travel industries, to help them embrace innovation and use technology to drive their services forward into the future.
