<p>Over the past year, members of the pebble{code} and pebble.it teams have been mentoring 6th form students from The Lilian Bayliss Technology school. Through regular meetings and discussions we’re hoping to help these promising young students with guidance and advice in their studies, further education choices and careers paths.</p>
<p>A couple of these students joined us for a week of work experience during the half term holidays. We placed them within our UX/UI team and put them to work on the new pebble{code} website, as well as helping them with one of their pet projects. Here’s what Mohammed had to say about the experience:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Over the half term holidays I was privileged to work for one of the most prestigious software development companies in London. I sat with their web developers for a couple of days discovering and solving problems. I learnt the employable skills required put together with my web development knowledge to create the perfect software for clients. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and finally answered the question I have always been asking myself &quot;how do web developers work behind a desk?&rdquo;&ldquo;</em></p>
<p>Both teams at pebble{code} and pebble.it were mightily impressed by these students’ abilities to get stuck in and actively contribute to real-world projects. We’re convinced that the students we’ve met from LBTS have a bright future ahead of themselves.</p>
