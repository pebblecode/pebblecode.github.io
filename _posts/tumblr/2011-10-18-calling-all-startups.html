<p>Here at pebble we have been increasingly frustrated by the apparent difficulty of landing a nice juicy startup web development project due to our agency rates (even though actually relatively low). </p>

<p>The problem</p>

<p>Startups are often strapped for cash. They want the experience and knowledge that an agency likes ours can bring to the table, but don&rsquo;t like the price tag of a full-service agency, settling usually for a distributed team of freelancers that have never worked together. Also, when a piece of work like this is won by an agency, then at the end of the development cycle the startup is left with no in-house knowledge of how their app is put together - they have to pay the agency more money to either handover (not ideal) or carry on developing or maintaining.</p>

<p>Our solution</p>

<p>We understand the above - it is a big ask for startups, especially with ever increasingly savvy investors. We now offer to help startups get their projects off the ground by getting those essential foundations down and help them build their own development team that they can then run with once ready. </p>

<p>We have a big network of developers and find it easier to recruit than startups. We have app experience so can offer an outsourced CTO / Senior Developer role while also setting the startup on the right course in terms of User Interface and User Experience design. </p>

<p>Yes this does mean a shorter engagement and ultimately less money, but it allows us to work on the fun, interesting and challenging projects that get us all excited. Win.</p>

<p>Are you a startup? </p>

<p>Interested in this approach (you should be) - give us a call and we can discuss further. We really believe that this benefits all. We even have some office space for this purpose, making those few intense startup weeks or months more focused and productive.</p>

<p>Watch this space</p>

<p>We will be announcing a very exciting opportunity for one lucky startup soon&hellip;</p>
