<p>Big data is the buzzword of the times. Yesterday, we were privileged to attend the Big Data in Pharma conference in London. It was a fascinating insight into how the conservative and risk-averse pharmaceutical industry is using the cloud, analytics and a wider range of data sources to speed up the laborious process of getting drugs to market.<!-- more --><em><br/></em></p>
<p>Strong regulatory frameworks dictate a series of strenuous stages through which any potential drug must pass. This process is extremely expensive - as much as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/02/10/the-truly-staggering-cost-of-inventing-new-drugs/">$1.3 billion</a>. Despite this, testing can never be perfect and mistakes <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6192603/ns/health-arthritis/t/report-vioxx-linked-thousands-deaths/#.UwXMmEJ_v5Q">still happen</a>. </p>
<p>The promise of Big Data is that with more sophisticated analytical processes, conventional <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/316/7126/201">RCT</a> data can be combined with unconventional data from sources such as social media, general practitioner records, email text analysis or even speech recognition.</p>
<p>This has many potential benefits to the industry: </p>
<ul><li>New uses for existing drugs can be discovered. For example, some anti-depressants are also used by doctors to control premature ejaculation. The discovery that GPs are using drugs to treat conditions that are &lsquo;off-label&rsquo; allows the pharmaceutical company to market that drug to a wider range of uses. These discoveries can be made by using big data.</li>
<li>Unrecognised side effects can be discovered faster. In one example, the marketing team for a new drug were surprised that GPs stopped prescribing their product. They thought there were no issues as they had only received 3 phone calls about side effects. It turns out there had been over 750 tweets from patients regarding severe toxicity of the drug. The use of big data to analyse these sources of information would have allowed them to react better to these adverse circumstances.</li>
</ul><p><strong>pebble {code} and big data</strong></p>
<p>At pebble {code} we are proud to be making a contribution to the big data revolution in pharmaceuticals. For the last year, we have been working with <a href="http://www.astrazeneca.com/">AstraZeneca</a> to revolutionise the way their scientists make discoveries. We have been creating a suite of HTML5 apps that allow users to make new discoveries in the literature, find new science as it breaks, work out who the key players are in any given field, and connect within the organisation to other people who have similar interests or skills.</p>

<p>As an example, this picture shows Nick Brown of AstraZeneca presenting an app that allows the user to enter any combination of search terms, and receive a list of the key players in that field. A social network graph allows the user to determine how the players are linked. This is an app that a previous contractor failed to build effectively in a whole year. pebble {code} was able to build it in 2 days.</p>
<p><strong>Continuing work with AstraZeneca</strong></p>
<p>Our agile process means that our programme of app building is already responding to the feedback of the scientific community within AstraZeneca. Iterative improvements are creating successively slicker experiences, and new ideas for apps are popping up all the time. We are extremely excited to be creating a class-leading enterprise search app platform, and will update this blog with further developments in the future. </p>
