<p>A few months back, we moved into a bigger and better space. It has been a really fantastic move for us and we love it! We are still in Vauxhall and all very happy.</p> 

<p>Here are a couple of pics to give you a flavour - if you&rsquo;re in the area, why not drop by for a cup tea and a biscuit?! </p> 

<p>Luv, <br/><i>pebble {code}</i></p>
