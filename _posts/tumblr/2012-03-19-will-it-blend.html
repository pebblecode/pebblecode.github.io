<p>Yes!</p>



<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with Illustrator&rsquo;s blend tool. After a little trial and error I’ve developed a few tricks for producing interesting gradient-based effects with the specified steps setting. Now that I’m pretty comfortable with the techniques I’ve developed I thought it was time to share.</p>



<p>First let have a look at how the blend tool works.</p>



<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.272348694736138">Start by drawing two parallel lines. It doesn&rsquo;t mater how you style these lines. Just make sure that the lines are parallel and (for now) they have the same style. </span></p>

<p>Next go to the top menu : object &gt; blend &gt; blend options. Select specified steps for spacing. Input 8 for the number of spaces. And select “align to path” from the two buttons.</p>

<p>Next go to the top menu : object &gt; blend &gt; make. You can see illustrator has rendered us some more lines between the two we started with.</p>

<p>Larger numbers in the specified steps field give you more lines, lower numbers less. Simples. This is essentially how the blend to works with specified steps.</p>

<p>Now things get interesting. Blending two paths with either different thicknesses or colours will (yeah you guessed it) blends between the two values.</p>



<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m14o7ttp7q1r1hmko.png"/></p>



<p>We don’t just have to use simple paths, we can use shapes / grouped objects as well.</p>



<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m14o8bTZPV1r1hmko.png"/></p>



<p>Any (vector) effects you have on the paths will also be blended. Here we have zig-zag (smooth), roughen, and scribble. <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m14o90HM4v1r1hmko.png"/></p>



<p>We can combine all these elements to make some pretty strange visuals. This is an example of a thin blue line with the roughen effect applied blended with a fat pink line with the zig-zag effect applied.</p>



<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m14o9sKCge1r1hmko.png"/></p>



<p>Now we can use this technique to create a thousand different type of visuals. We can make ordered patterns, psychedelic abstract compositions, and even use it to create (relatively) subtle type treatments. </p>

<p>If you have any questions or if you've used this technique to create something, please let us know in the comments. Above all, have fun with it. The blend tool is my current favorite vector tool because it lets you experiment easily and sometimes gives you results you just weren't expecting. </p>
