<p>As a small software company, pebble.code needs to find the best programmers we can afford, but without spending an arm and a leg on recruitment firms, and ideally without taking our senior staff off their project work for weeks at a time.  This has proved quite a challenge, so I decided to share some thoughts.  </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t afford to make mistakes when hiring developers, and I&rsquo;d been feeling that our process to date was somewhat lacking in rigour.  We&rsquo;ve managed to hire some awesome developers, but have also made some mistakes, particular when hiring for contract rolls.  In the past we&rsquo;ve hired contract staff in an <a title="The Mythical Man Month" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">often futile</a> attempt to add additional resource to an already stressed project. Perhaps because time lines are already tight, our recruitment of contractors has been even less rigorous than that of permanent hires.</p>
<p>In the past our recruitment process looked something like this:</p>
<ul><li>Post a vacancy on our website</li>
<li>Publicise via <a href="http://www.gumtree.com/computing-it-jobs/london">gumtree</a> &amp; social media</li>
<li>Telephone interview the best 7/8 candidates</li>
<li>Face to face interview the best 3, asking a mixture of CV based enquiries and common CS questions</li>
<li>Make an Offer (hopefully)</li>
</ul><p><strong>Slow!</strong></p>
<p>One of the major problems with this approach was the amount of time a time leader would have to spend.  Between CV shortlisting and telephone interviews, the manager recruiting will have spent around a full day of their time on recruitment before even seeing any code that a candidate has written.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem with CVs</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve learnt the hard way that you can&rsquo;t hire a programmer on the strength of their CV.  In fact, as numerous telephone interviews have proven, it&rsquo;s not just common for prospective candidates to ham up their technical skillset, it&rsquo;s endemic!  We had figured that this should be caught most of the time at interview by talking to candidates about their experiences of using various tools or frameworks, but realised over time that there&rsquo;s just no substitute for seeing a developer write some actual code. </p>
<p><strong>Developer Recruitment 2.0</strong></p>
<p>We decided to turn this process on its head.  Instead of waiting for a post start code review to see a candidate&rsquo;s handy work, it&rsquo;s now the first thing that we request.  After all, you wouldn&rsquo;t hire an architect without seeing a house they&rsquo;d built.  Once we&rsquo;ve shortlisted CVs, candidates are asked to complete <a title="Programming Battleships" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWQxmvEsUxBkqRs4LOcBwVHuguMTFgl0RJi_VasX9qc/edit?hl=en_GB&amp;authkey=CPPD35ED">a programming challenge</a> in their own time.  It&rsquo;s a simple programming task, providing an opportunity for developers to demonstrate their OO analysis skills.  Experience shows that candidates need to spend about 2-3 hours of their time to complete the task.  The effect has been to reduce the number of shortlisted CVs that make it to the next stage - this challenge puts off about 50% of candidates that would otherwise have taken a telephone interview.  That&rsquo;s just fine with us though - we&rsquo;d like to work with programmers that see this sort of task as a bit of fun and are keen enough to work with pebble.code that they&rsquo;re happy to put aside a couple of hours one evening to work some code.</p>
<p>Candidates that turn in good code will be invited for face to face interviews, an opportunity for both parties to size each other up.  We&rsquo;ve found that the face to face interview is now much more productive.  The developers ability can be determined to some degree from their submitted code, and that code tends to forms the basis of about 50% of the interview - usually including a bit of on the spot refactoring pair programming style - something that we regular practice in house anyway.  </p>
