<p>Here at pebble {code} we have our heads firmly out of the sand.  We believe in climate change and that as a responsible company we should be doing everything in our power to mitigate it&rsquo;s effects.  That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re proud to shout about being a customer of <a href="http://www.ecotricity.co.uk/">Ecotricity</a>.  Their new campaign to &ldquo;<a href="http://zerocarbonista.com/2012/02/08/dump-the-big-six-go-on-you-know-you-want-to/">Dump the Big Six</a>&rdquo; strikes a chord here at pebble - there&rsquo;s literally no reason not to switch your energy company today, away from one of the big 6, to a cleaner, greener supplier.</p>
