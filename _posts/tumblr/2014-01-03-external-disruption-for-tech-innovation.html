<p>Gate keepers, security, working practises, bureaucracy, legacy, methodologies&hellip; These are all really important things that businesses need to train and mould their employees and users to do, but, they all get in the way of innovation, creativity, delivery and progress.</p>

<p>Businesses should outsource their tech innovation problems to smaller, more agile companies (like pebble {code}!). These agile companies have a thirst for new tech, innovation and creativity and can deliver worlds quicker than the in-house guys. This is nothing against the in-house talent, it is just that they are not encouraged to think and do it this way.</p>

<p>Software development should be thought of like science. How do scientists make progress? Trial and error. Why do businesses not do the same? Fear of failure.</p>

<p>At pebble {code}, we take our clients on a voyage of discovery. With our hack days, clients get to put their problems in the ring and have some extremely talented people have a crack at solving those problems. Some work, some don&rsquo;t, but the whole process is informative, motivating and gets new ideas out there quickly.</p>

<p>If we can create 10 apps in a day, it really does not have to cost you the earth to test different approaches directly with the ultimate users of the software. If you go done the traditional route of specifying everything then you run the risk of ending up with a space craft to search the ocean.</p>

<p>Lesson: failure does not have to cost the earth and/or your job. When done right it is the most positive thing you can do in your software development process, it cultivates ideas and motivates the rest of your in-house team to think differently. It is positive disruption. </p>
