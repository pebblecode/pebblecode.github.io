<p>Check out what we got up to last Friday here </p>

<p>The brief was to make a festive app and the team threw everything at it; we left no part of Christmas unexplored.</p>
<p>From those amongst who are obviously ground down by the relentlessness of an e-commerce Christmas  who created a browser filter that intelligently weeds out any image or mention that might be Xmas related to the really committed philanthropists who created a way to share seasonal love around the world, we made it.</p>
<p>We created interactive games, social music apps, even a beautiful handcrafted DIY animation. Using two plastic cups.</p>
<p>This is what pebble {code} lives for - a challenge that we investigate and solve collaboratively. We don&rsquo;t save this creative and playful approach just for high days and holidays - this is how we like to tackle all our client work as well.</p>
<p>Our best development is always kicked off with a Hack Day with our clients where we run riot, trying, testing, inventing, failing, breaking, but above all learning about the possible ways to approach a particular challenge.</p>
<p>So check out the video and watch out for more posts this week for detail about our Hackmas apps.</p>
