<p>Our Creative Director, George (<a href="http://twitter.com/shapeshed">@shapeshed</a>), took to the stage on Monday night to give a talk on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. The event was hosted by <a href="http://www.forwardtechnology.co.uk/">Forward</a> who gave us free beer and pizza - thank you Forward! </p>

<p>The evening was a great success - as we heard from numerous people afterwards - and it was great to hear from a few companies that are already creating successful applications using Node.js. </p>

<p>George is also writing a book on the subject, titled &rsquo;<a href="http://nodejsbook.io/the-author/">Sam&rsquo;s Teach Yourself Node.js in 24 Hours</a>&rsquo;. It is due for release later this year and you can pre-order on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Node-js-Hours/dp/0672335956/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329305805&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon</a>.</p>
