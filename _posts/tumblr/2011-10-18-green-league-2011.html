<p>We&rsquo;re super excited to finally be able to announce that we've been working on an iPhone app over the last month or so, in collaboration with our favourite environment organisation, <a title="People &amp; Planet" href="http://peopleandplanet.org/">People &amp; Planet</a>. People and Planet is the largest student network in Britain campaigning to end world poverty, defend human rights and protect the environment. The award-winning People &amp; Planet <a href="http://peopleandplanet.org/greenleague">Green League</a> is the only ranking of UK universities by environmental and ethical performance.  This year 142 unis took part, and the results were released in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/people-and-planet-green-league">today&rsquo;s Guardian newspaper</a>.  We think it&rsquo;s a great project, providing prospective and current uni students with a tool to demand and justify change in their unis.  Download it now and give it a whirl.</p>

<p>The app, whipped up by our in house iPhone wizz <a href="http://pebbleit.com/team/">Tak</a>, provides university search and comparison features.  For those students applying through UCAS for the next academic year, this app provides a really neat way to compare uni choices on a sustainability basis, allowing students to checkup on their uni&rsquo;s ethical &amp; environmental performance in a number of fields, whilst on the move.  Hopefully it&rsquo;ll lead to a few awkward questions on campus tours too - there&rsquo;s nothing like customer pressure to drive change! </p>
