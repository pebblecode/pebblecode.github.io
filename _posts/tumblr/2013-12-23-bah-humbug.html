<p><em>&ldquo;Every idiot who goes about with &lsquo;Merry Christmas&rsquo; on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.&rdquo;</em>
-Ebenezer Scrooge</p>

<p>Whilst most of my pebble comrades were spreading Christmas cheer  with <a href="http://blog.pebblecode.com/blog/christmas-hugs-hug-humanity">hugs</a>, <a href="http://blog.pebblecode.com/blog/irl-christmas-novelty-wall">interactive murals</a>, and <a href="http://blog.pebblecode.com/blog/happy-sad-santa-an-app-from-our-hackmas-day">happy Santas</a> I decided to take a slightly less merry approach.</p>

<p>Fed up with christmas invading our lives for more and more time each year, I created <a href="http://pebblecode.github.io/zero-christmas/">Zero Christmas</a> a simple bookmarklet that lets you censor any mention of christmas from a web page. I borrowed (stole) heavily from another pebble hack I had created for the Olympics hack day, <a href="http://pebblecode.github.io/fear-the-IOC/">Fear the IOC</a>. I refactored the code a little, added a 'naughty list&rsquo; of christmas words, and detection and destruction of christmas colours in css. See below for an example.</p>

<p>I also tried to implement <a href="https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief">color-thief</a> to detect christmasy images automatically. Alas the time restraints of the hack-day defeated me and I didn&rsquo;t get this working.</p>

<p>Try Zero Christmas for yourself <a href="http://pebblecode.github.io/zero-christmas/">here</a> and let us know what you think in the comments.</p>

<p>Bah! humbug!</p>
