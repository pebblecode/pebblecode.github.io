<p>Let&rsquo;s frame where we are coming from - pebble {code} is a software company with (much) less than £50M turnover and less than £300K profit&hellip;</p>

<p>What does this mean for us? </p>

<p>Well, for now, Corporation Tax will remain at 20% - fine. However, if you are a business with greater than £300K profit, you are down to 24%, from 26% - good. </p>

<p>There is good news for us software developers if we have patents - Patent Box says that profits made from patents will only be charged at 10% Corporation Tax - good. </p>

<p>No reduction in business rates - bad. Instead they will go ahead with a rise to 5.6% - grr. There is also no reduction on fuel tax - not a biggy for us, but still - bad.</p>

<p>In terms of cash, a number of banks have signed up to the National Loan Guarantee Scheme that will have banks lending at 1% lower rates than those outside of the scheme for businesses with less than £50M turnover - this is good if you are able get a loan approved in the first place! </p>

<p>So, that is a very quick round up of what that Government&rsquo;s Budget 2012 has meant for us as a small business. Not lots of good news, but not dreadful. </p>

<p>There is however another very interesting Government scheme that has come to our attention recently - <a href="http://www.seis.co.uk/">SEIS</a> or <a href="http://www.seis.co.uk/">Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme</a>. In a nutshell it offers massive tax breaks for investors wanting to invest in startups. Rightly so, the chancellor sees us small businesses as the life blood of the economy. Boom!</p>
