It’s another early morning in London. A select few members of pebble {code} are gathering on a shady corner in Islington - a far cry from our usual south London home. Some of us clasp at hot cups of coffee. Others stand buzzing from the adrenaline of cycling round the city’s most notoriously dangerous roundabout. But spirits are high all round at the thought of starting our first Design Thinking workshop on patient engagement, with one of the UK’s largest charities. Armed with our wits, stacks of paper and a large stash of 80’s neon Sharpie pens, we head inside to set up.

	As 9:00 rolls around, the group from the charity pours through the door, armed with healthy snacks for the day. Moments later, hot beverages arrive, accompanied by a large silver platter of biscuits. I watched closely as willpower crumbled to dust and was swept away in the breeze. The apples and oranges barely stood a chance.
</p><h2>Let’s Begin.</h2><p>
	The group was split in to four teams. We planned to work through a series of exercises throughout the day, with each team assisted by a Pebbler. Each activity would lead in to the next, developing, refining and challenging ideas throughout the morning, with a strong focus on drawing as a technique for documenting ideas. This was not about being an artist, but encouraging people to be explicit and specific about their ideas and decisions.</p><p>
	But first things first, and in the words of John Mildinhall, (our Creative Director) “What do we do before exercise? We warm up!” Luckily for those who forgot their gym kit, it was creative juices we wanted flowing, rather than blood pumping. No star jumps here thankfully. (Although obviously pebble {code} encourages a healthy lifestyle!)</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/b925eec24df8b2959ffa843c9fb17009/tumblr_inline_nmfxzj4aDg1qetc8f_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667"/></figure><p>
	Warm up part one asked everyone to create their Post-It Social Media Profile. A quick selfie sketch and a written bio functioned as an icebreaker between groups, while also ensuring everyone got in to the practice of sketching, writing and sharing ideas.
</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/3596a959065098d0ecf4c9177e1a582b/tumblr_inline_nmfxzx5NuT1qetc8f_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667"/></figure><p>
	Warm up part 2 was drawing a tattoo. (No, not a real one.) The aim here was to get people to be a little more creative with their sketching, whilst also demonstrating what the charity meant to them as an employee.
</p><p>
	Once everyone had unleashed his or her inner Michelangelo it was time for the first task.
</p><h2>Draw The Problem.</h2><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/359c7e429d9221511999787451bb55cf/tumblr_inline_nmfy0adPhw1qetc8f_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667"/></figure><p>
	Whilst everyone was here for a common purpose, but being from different walks of life and sectors of the charity, it was likely they all saw things from slightly alternate viewpoints. Through discussion and sketching they were asked to visualise what they saw as the key concerns for the problem they were trying to solve. Individuals could work alone at first to describe problem through their eyes, but groups had to create a single vision by the end of the allotted time. The list of characters involved in each drawn process would lead us directly in to exercise number two.
</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/fb02c1ae860f7ec78b464b378409b913/tumblr_inline_nmfy0nc3tg1qetc8f_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667"/></figure><h2>Empathy Mapping.</h2><p>
	By mapping out the problem the group had indirectly created a list of people who were involved or affected by the problem. Before a solution can be pieced together, you need to know your target audience. The room had amassed a broad list of individuals, from friends and co-workers to pharmacists and teachers, so it was clear that the groups were engaging with the tasks well. We assigned each group 5 people. They were asked to summarise 6 key actions for each persona: Hearing, Thinking, Seeing, Feeling, Saying and Doing. Once complete, each group could hope to have a much clearer idea of the problem they were looking to solve, and the roles that each person played in achieving the solution. But all this Monday morning thinking can be exhausting, which meant it was high time we stopped for refreshments.

	We basked in the mid morning sun for 10 beautiful minutes. Spring had truly arrived. As the golden rays bounced off London’s rooftops I &hellip; sorry &hellip; time’s up &hellip; we’ve got real work to be getting on with!
</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/0c8bce27f00ad76343447268f0454ed2/tumblr_inline_nmfy1kCO8N1qetc8f_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667"/></figure><h2>Put It To The Test.</h2><p>
	With the teams reassembled, they were asked to pick out one specific issue from the morning’s session to think up (and sketch down) a solution to. When they thought they were done each team would be dealt a card. On this card would be a constraint. A constraint card might say “it ships today”, “keep it simple” or “take it outside”. The solution then had to be redrawn according to this restriction.
</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/ae26200cf3c0b3efc57d92ef8a3b7594/tumblr_inline_nmfy2anN931qetc8f_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667"/></figure><p>
	Once done, another card was dealt&hellip;
	<br/><br/>
	And then another&hellip;
	<br/><br/>
	And then another&hellip;
	<br/><br/>
	Four were played in total, forcing the teams to tweak, refine, flip and distil their thoughts until they could draw no more.
</p><figure data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/1ff2fb2b76f0fc55677a959479e01530/tumblr_inline_nmfy2krXGb1qetc8f_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1000" data-orig-height="667"/></figure><h2>Lessons Learned.</h2><p>
	As coloured pens fell from cramping hands, we called the session to an end. A final presentation of ideas from each group rounded the day off. Perhaps we have taken the first steps down a path to a better future of charity care. But, if nothing else, we hope to have opened up a few people’s minds to the merits of sketching your ideas, because, in the words of David Hockney:
</p><p><i>
	“Drawing makes you see things clearer, and clearer and clearer still, until your eyes ache.”
